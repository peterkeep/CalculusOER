<div class="para">Describe a sequence of numbers where you use a consistent rule/function to build each term (each number) based only on the <em class="emphasis">previous term</em> in the sequence. You will need to decide on some first term to start your sequence.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Describe a different sequence of numbers using the same rule to generate new terms/numbers from the previous one. What do you need to do to make these two sequences different from each other?</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Describe a new sequence of numbers where you use a consistent rule/function to build each term based on its position in the sequence (i.e. the first term will be some rule/function based on the input 1, the second will be based on 2, you’ll use 3 to get the third term, etc.). We will call the position of each term in the sequence the <em class="emphasis">index</em>.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<div class="para">Describe another, new, sequence of numbers where you use a consistent rule/function to build each term based on its index. This time, make the terms get smaller in size as the index increases.</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-IntroSequences.html#act-FirstSequences">in-context</a></span>
