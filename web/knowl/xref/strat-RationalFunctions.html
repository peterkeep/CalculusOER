<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(n=m-1\)</span> (the degree of the numerator is one less than the degree of the denominator), then we can try a <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution where <span class="process-math">\(u=p_m(x)\text{,}\)</span> since the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(p_m(x)\)</span> is a polynomial of degree <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> If this substitution works, we can antidifferentiate to get some sort of logarithm.</div>
<div class="para">This is not guaranteed to work, but for now (without other strategies), this is something we can think about.</div>

<li><div class="para">If we can reduce <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> (through some transformation or substitution) to a rational function that is a constant term divided by quadratic function (or if it already is), then we can complete the square in the denominator to get to a form that can be antidifferentiated to an inverse tangent function.</div></li>
