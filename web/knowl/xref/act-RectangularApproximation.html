<div class="introduction"><div class="para">We’re going to stick with the function <span class="process-math">\(g(x)=x^2+1\)</span> on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\text{,}\)</span> and keep thinking about the area bounded by the curve and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis on this interval. We’re going to approximate the area in a couple of different tries, each one more accurate than the one before. By the end of this activity, we’ll have a pretty good process built!</div></div>

<div class="para">Let’s start with approximating this region with a single rectangle. We’re going to define the rectangle by picking some <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-value in the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\text{.}\)</span> Then, we’ll use the point at that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-value to define the height of our rectangle.</div> <div class="para">Essentially, we are picking a single point on the our function on the interval and our approximation is pretending that the single point we picked is representative of the whole function on the interval.</div> <iframe id="act-RectangularApproximation-3-1-3" width="570" height="684" src="act-RectangularApproximation-3-1-3-if.html"></iframe></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>

<div class="para">We’re going to use more rectangles. Let’s jump up to 3 rectangles.
