  "title": "The Definition of the Limit",
  "body": " The Definition of the Limit   Almost 2,500 years ago, the Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea gifted the world with a set of philosophical paradoxes that provide the foundation for how we will begin our study of calculus. Perhaps the most famous of Zeno's paradoxes is the paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise.    Achilles and the Tortoise  In the paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise, the Greek hero Achilles is in a race with a tortoise. Obviously the tortoise is much slower than Achilles, and so the tortoise gets a 100m head start. The race begins, and while the tortoise moves as quickly as it can, Achilles has the obvious advantage. They both are running at a constant speed, with Achilles running faster. Achilles runs 100m, catching up to the tortoise's starting point.  In the meantime, the tortoise has moved 2 meters. Achilles has almost caught up and passed the tortoise at this point! In a very short time, Achilles is able to run the 2 meters to catch up to where the tortoise was. Unfortunately, in that short amount of time, the tortoise has kept on moving, and is farther along by now.  Every time Achilles catches up to where the tortoise was, the tortoise has moved farther along, and Achilles has to keep catching up.  Can Achilles, the paragon of athleticism, ever catch the tortoise?    A Modern Retelling  A college student is excited about having enrolled in their first calculus class. On the first day of class, they head to class. When they enter the hallway with their classroom at the end, they take a breath and excitedly head to class.  In order to get to class, though, they have to travel halfway down the hallway. Almost there.  Now, to go the rest of the way, the student will half to get to the point that is halfway between them and the door. Getting closer.  They're getting excited. Finally, their first calculus class! But to get to the class, they have to reach the point halfway between them and the door.  Their smile starts fading. They repeat the process, and go halfway from their position to the door. They're closer, but not there yet.  If they keep having to reach the new halfway point, and that halfway point is never actually at the door, then will they ever get there?  Halfway to the door, then halfway again, closer and closer without ever getting there.  Will the student ever get there, or are they doomed to keep getting closer and closer without ever reaching the door?    Defining a Limit     How do we formalize this idea of thinking about what happens \"as we get close\" to something?      Limit of a Function   For the function defined at all -xalues around (except maybe at itself), we say that the limit as approaches of is if is arbitrarily close to the single, real number whenever is sufficiently close to, but not equal to, . We write this as: or sometimes we write when .     "

  "title": "Integration By Parts",
  "body": " Integration By Parts   We've seen now that is a useful technique for undo-ing . We set up the variable substitution with the specific goal of going backwards through the Chain Rule and antidifferentiating some composition of functions.  A reasonable next step is to ask: What other derivative rules can we \"undo?\" What other operations between functions should we think about? This brings us to Integration by Parts, the integration technique specifically for undo-ing .    Discovering the Integration by Parts Formula   Discovering the Integration by Parts Formula   The product rule for derivatives says that: . We know that we intend to \"undo\" the product rule, so let's try to re-frame the product rule from a rule about derivatives to a rule about antiderivatives.    Antidifferentiate the product rule by antidifferentiating each side of the equation.    Note that on the left side of this equation you're antidifferentiating a derivative. What will that give you? Then, on the right side, we're just splitting up the terms of the product rule into two different integrals.    On the right side, we have two integrals. Since each of them has a product of functions (one function and a derivative of another), we can isolate one of them in this equation and create a formula for how to antidifferentiate a product of functions! Solve for .    Look back at this formula for . Explain how this is really the product rule for derivatives (without just undo-ing all of the steps we have just done).    What made it so useful to pick instead of in this case? Since we know that we are going to get another integral, one that specifically has the new derivative and new antiderivative that we find from the parts we picked, we noticed that differentiating the function was much nicer than antidifferentiating it: we get a constant that we multiply by the trig function in this new integral, instead of a power function with an even bigger exponent. We can also notice that when it comes to the trig function, it doesn't really matter if we differentiate it or antidifferentiate it. In both cases, we get a in our new integral, with the only difference being whether it is positive or negative.    We typically use the substitutions and to re-write the integrals.   Integration by Parts   Suppose and are both differentiable functions. Then: .    When we select the parts for our integral, we are selecting a function to be labeled and a function to be labeled as . We begin with one of the pieces of the product rule, a function multiplied by some other function's derivative. It is important to recognize that we do different things to these functions: for one of them, , we need to find the derivative, . For the other, , we need to find an antiderivative, . Because of these differences, it is important to build some good intuition for how to select the parts.    Intuition for Selecting the Parts   Picking the Parts for Integration by Parts   Let's consider the integral: . We'll investigate how to set up the integration by parts formula with the different choices for the parts.    We'll start with selecting and . Fill in the following with the rest of the pieces:     Now set up the integration by parts formula using your labeled pieces. Notice that the integration by parts formula gives us another integral. Don't worry about antidifferentiating this yet, let's just set the pieces up.        Let's swap the pieces and try the setup with and . Fill in the following with the rest of the pieces:     Now set up the integration by parts formula using this setup.        Compare the two results we have. Which setup do you think will be easier to move forward with? Why?   When we say we need to keep moving forward with our setup, what we mean is that we have another integral to antidifferentiate. Which one will be easier to work with: or ?    Finalize your work with the setup you have chosen to find .    What made things so much better when we chose compared to ? We know that the new integral from our integration by parts formula will be built from the new pieces, the derivative we find from and the antiderivative we pick from . So when we differentiate , we get a constant, compared to antidifferentiating and getting another power function, but with a larger exponent. We know this will be combined with a function no matter what (since the derivative and antiderivatives of will only differ in their sign). So picking the version that gets that second integral to be built from a trig function and a constant is going to be much nicer than a trig function and a power function. It was nice to pick to be the piece that we found the derivative of!    Let's practice this comparison with another example in order to build our intuition for picking the parts in our integration by parts formula.   Picking the Parts for Integration by Parts   This time we'll look at a very similar integral: . Again, we'll set this up two different ways and compsare them.    We'll start with selecting and . Fill in the following with the rest of the pieces:    You're not forgetting how to antidifferentiate . This is just something we don't know yet!    Ok, so here we have to swap the pieces and try the setup with and , since we only know how to differentiate . Fill in the following with the rest of the pieces:     Now set up the integration by parts formula using this setup.        Why was it fine for us to antidifferentiate in this example, but not in ?    Finish this work to find .   Notice that .    So here, we didn't actually get much choice. We couldn't pick in order to differentiate it (and get a constant to multiply into our second integral) since we don't know how to antidifferentiate (yet: once we know how, it might be fun to come back to this problem and try it again with the parts flipped). But we can also notice that it ended up being fine to antidifferentiate : the increased power from our power rule didn't really matter much when we combined it with the derivative of the logarithm, since the derivative of the log is also a power function ! So we were able to combine those easily and actually integrate that second integral.     It is common for students to want to place functions into sort of hierarchy or classification guidelines for choosing the parts. Some students have found that the acronym LIPET (logs, inverse trig, power functions, exponentials, and trig functions) can be a useful tool for selecting the parts. When you have two different types of functions, it might help to select to be whichever function shows up first in that list.     Integrate the following:        It doesn't matter whether we differentiate or antidifferentiate , since we'll get the same thing. Let's pick so that we can differentiate it.     We need to do more integration by parts!          We don't know how to antidifferentiate , but we do know how to differentiate it!           Some Flexible Choices for Parts  We're going to look at a couple of examples where we can showcase some of the flexibility we have with our choices of parts. First, we'll revisit .In this example, when we got to that second integral, we noticed that for the fraction , we could either do some long division (since the degrees in the numerator and denominator are the same) or do some clever re-writing of the numerator. Either way, we know that this fraction is almost 1...It's really some bit (in this case, the extra bit was a fraction ).  What if we chose our parts differently? Not the and parts, though, since we still haven't figured out how to antidifferentiate . But we get one more choice!  Once we choose , we don't really get a separate choice for : it's simply the derivative of with regard to multiplied by the differential . But consider our choice of , and the subsequent process of finding . Yes, there's only one possible answer, but in a much more real sense, there isn't just one possible answer. There are an infinite number of them! We know, due to the and then later due to , that there are an infinite number of antiderivatives, all differing by at most a constant term. So let's pick a more appropriate antiderivative!    Integrate , this time making a more intentional choice for .    Note that if we pick , then the second integral will be just delightful.          So we get the same thing, but didn't have to think through the long division or the forced factoring. But the trade off here is that we almost have to see this coming to notice it. This flexibility doesn't always come into play for us. But we can look at a different kind of flexibility.  We've looked at integrals with both and . For these, and for other inverse functions specifically, we pick them to be the part in our integration by parts problems because we don't know how do antidifferentiate them.  So let's look at , and we'll solve this integral by, specifically, differentiating instead of antidifferentiating it.   Antidifferentiating the Log Function   Integrate .    Pick , since we can differentiate it. What does that leave for ?          We can use this same strategy to find antiderivatives of , , and eventually .   For , we'll need to use this same tactic of setting and , but then later on we'll need to use a technique called to finish the problem.   Now that we know the antiderivative family for , we can revisit the problem in , , and try to work through the integration by parts when and .    Integrate .      Note that this last integral is really recognizable: it's the one we started with! Let's \"solve\" this equation for that integral by adding it to both sides of our equation.       Solving for the Integral  In this last example, we ended up seeing the original integral repeated when we did integration by parts. This is a useful technique, especially when we deal with functions that have a kind of \"repeating\" structure to their derivatives or antiderivatives. We'll look at a couple of classic integrals where we see this kind of technique employed.    For each of the following integrals, use integration by parts to solve.        This one is pretty straight forward, since it doesn't really matter what we select as our parts. Notice, though, that this isn't the only way we can approach this! We can use -substitution, or even re-write this using a trigonometric identity.                     Notice that we can come up with a bunch of different examples that are similar to . If we put trigonometric functions inside our integral, we'll have some options with how we approach them! We can use -substitution, since the derivatives of trigonometric functions are other trigonometric functions. In , for instance, we could write and , or even chose and .  The real issues will come when our integrand is not just a product of two trigonometric functions, but when they are products of trigonometric functions raised to exponents. We'll have some combinations of these products (which maybe makes us think about integration by parts) and composition (which points towards -substitution). In the next section, we'll develop some strategies to deal with these kinds of integrals.   "

  "body": " Discovering the Integration by Parts Formula   The product rule for derivatives says that: . We know that we intend to \"undo\" the product rule, so let's try to re-frame the product rule from a rule about derivatives to a rule about antiderivatives.    Antidifferentiate the product rule by antidifferentiating each side of the equation.    Note that on the left side of this equation you're antidifferentiating a derivative. What will that give you? Then, on the right side, we're just splitting up the terms of the product rule into two different integrals.    On the right side, we have two integrals. Since each of them has a product of functions (one function and a derivative of another), we can isolate one of them in this equation and create a formula for how to antidifferentiate a product of functions! Solve for .    Look back at this formula for . Explain how this is really the product rule for derivatives (without just undo-ing all of the steps we have just done).    What made it so useful to pick instead of in this case? Since we know that we are going to get another integral, one that specifically has the new derivative and new antiderivative that we find from the parts we picked, we noticed that differentiating the function was much nicer than antidifferentiating it: we get a constant that we multiply by the trig function in this new integral, instead of a power function with an even bigger exponent. We can also notice that when it comes to the trig function, it doesn't really matter if we differentiate it or antidifferentiate it. In both cases, we get a in our new integral, with the only difference being whether it is positive or negative.   "

In , we performed a -substitution, but needed to work to re-write our whole integrand in terms of . Specifically, we found that in the numerator, there was an , but . We were substituting out a linear function of in the numerator, but the actual function was cubic. This wasn't a problem: we re-wrote , and noticed that the extra was able to be substituted, since we could re-write out subsitution rule: we noted that is equivalent to . This meant that even though we had an extra factor of \"in\" the part that we were using for substituting in the differential , we were still able to translate the whole function to be written in terms of .  Then, more recently, in , we noted that we could use a mix of methods to integrate this:  One on hand, we can look at the structure of the integrand and notice that we have a product of two functions! Integration by parts was a fine strategy to employ, and that's what we did in the example. On the other hand, we noticed that since we have this function-derivative pairing, a -substitution was also appropriate.  In this section, we'll explore more combinations of trigonometric functions and build a strategy for antidifferentiating them that includes some ideas from both of these previous examples.    Building a Strategy for Powers of Sines and Cosines   Compare and Contrast   Let's do a quick comparison of two integrals, keeping the above examples in mind.

If both and are even, we can either use or use the following power-reducing trigonometric identities:        A strange note, here, is that we typically pick our -substitution based on looking to see a suitable candidate for : we look for functions that are composed \"inside\" of other functions or we look for a function whose derivative is in the integral (the \"function-derivative pair\" that we talk about in ). Here, though, we're selecting our substitution based on : we're looking to see which function we can set aside one copy of for the differential, and then have an even power left over so that we can apply the Pythagorean Identity to translate the rest.

  "title": "Integrals as Net Change",
  "body": " Integrals as Net Change   We have some rudimentary ideas of what an integral is, but we want to challenge and expand those ideas by examining the object at the root of the definition of the definite integral: a Riemann sum.    Estimating Movement  Here is some text leading to our first activity.   Estimating Movement   We're observing an object traveling back and forth in a straight line. Throughout a 5 minute interval, we get the following information about the velocity (in feet\/second) of the object.   Velocity of an Object        0  0    30  2    60  4.25    90  5.75    120  3.5    150  0.75    180  -1.25    210  -3.5    240  -2.75    270  -0.5    300  -0.25       Describe the motion of the object in general.   How do we interpret the different values of velocity? How do we interpret the sign of velocity? What about how velocity changes from one of the 30-second time points to the next?    When was the acceleration of the object the greatest? When was it the least?   You can decide how to interpret the \"least\" acceleration: it is either where the acceleration is closes to 0, or it is the most negative value of the acceleration. These are interpreted differently, but it's a bit ambiguous what we might mean when we say \"least acceleration.\"    Estimate the total displacement of the object over the 5 minute interval. What is the overall change in position from the start to the end?   How do we use velocity and some time interval to estimate the distance traveled? How do we estimate\/assume the velocity on each 30-second time interval?    Is this different than the total distance that the object traveled over the 5 minute interval? Why or why not?   How do we think about (or ignore) the direction of the object? Why is this important here?    If we know the initial position of the object, how could we find the position of the object at some time, , where is a multiple of 30 between 0 and 300?   Can we limit the time intervals that we use to calculate the object's displacement? How do we use displacement and a starting point to find an ending point?    So what are the big ideas in this short activity? There are a lot, and many of them are already things we know, at least to some level. So we are really focusing on adding depth to our understanding of these big ideas. Let's list them in the order that they showed up in this activity:   We interpret the velocity as the derivative of the position of the object. So when we interpret the value of the velocity of the object (large vs small, positive vs negative, etc.) we are interpreting these through the lens of a rate of change.    Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function. While we don't have the full picture of the velocity function at any value of , we still were interested in the rates at which velocity changes with regard to time.    We can estimate the total displacement of the object by predicting how far it traveled in eahc 30-second time interval. We might pick the starting velocity for each 30-second interval and multiply that by 30 seconds. We could alternatively pick the ending velocity of each 30-second interval. Then we can add all of these products of velocity and time together to approximate a total change in position! Doesn't this feel like a Riemann sum?    When we calculate displacement, the negative velocities get multiplied out to get negative changes in position for the object -- that's because a negative velocity means that the object is moving backwards. If we wanted to calculate the distance traveled, then we need to not account for negative velocities. We can just disregard the sign of the velocity on each time interval and repeat the process above. So, another Riemann sum then?    In order to forecast some position at time , we just need to start with the initial position, and then calculate (or approximate) the displacement from to whatever time we care about, and then add the displacement to the intitial position.   Ok, now let's formalize those results!    Position, Velocity, and Acceleration  We know that the velocity of an object is really a rate of change of the position of that object with regard to time. Similarly, the acceleration of an object is the rate of change of the velocity of the object with regard to time. So we're really thinking about derivatives!    For an object moving along a straight line, if represents the position of that object at time , then the velocity of theobject at time is and the acceleration of the object at time is .    Once we establish this relationship, we can answer questions about movement of an object using the same interpretations of derivatives that we practiced in Chapter 3 of this text.   A Friendly Jogger   Consider a jogger running along a straight-line path, where their velocity at hours is , and velocity is measured in miles per hour. We begin observing this jogger at and observe them over a course of 3 hours.    When is the jogger's acceleration equal to 0 mi\/hr ?   Solve .    Does this time represent a maximum or minimum velocity for the jogger?   You can use the First Derivative Test or the Second Derivative Test here!    When is the jogger's velocity equal to 0 mi\/hr?    Describe the motion of the jogger, including information about the direction that they travel and their top speeds.      Displacement, Distance, and Speed  Let's revisit . When we approximated the displacement of the object, we built a Riemann sum: We chose our as either the time at the beginning of each 30-second interval or the time atr the end of the 30-second interval, but that was only because of the limited information that we had about different values of . If we had information about the function at any values of ( ), then we could pick any time in each 30-second time interval for our Riemann sum! We might note, though, that if we did have this kind of information about the velocity at any time in the 5-minute interval, then we would also build a more precise approximation by subdividing the time interval into smaller\/shorter pieces. So maybe the Riemann sum (where we are dividing up the 5 minute interval into 100 3-second intervals) would do a better job! But why stop there? If we have the definition of the velocity function, and so we can truly obtain the velocity of the object at any time in the 5 minute interval, then we can use the definition of the definite integral as the limit of a Riemann sum: This should work out well with our first understanding of displacement: the displacement of an object is just the difference in position from the starting time to the ending time. So we could say that if is the position function, then we might expect to represent displacement from to as . But isn't this just the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since ?    If an object is moving along a straight line with velocity and position , then the displacement of the object from time to is     Let's keep revisiting the same activity. We also noticed that when we looked at the distance compared to the displacement, the only difference was that we were integrating the absolute value of the velocity function, since we didn't care about the sign of the velocity (the direction that the object was traveling) on each interval.    If an object is moving along a straight line with velocity , then the distance traveled by the object from time to is: Here, we call the speed of the object (instead of the velocity).    We should note that we don't have any quick and easy ways of dealing with the integral of the absolute value of a function. So, in order for us to integrate , we need to think about where the velocity passes through 0, so that we can see where it might change from positive to negative.   Tracking our Jogger   Let's revisit our jogger from .    Calculate the total displacement of the jogger from to .   Set up and evaluate a definite integral here, using the velocity function.    Think back to our descroption of the jogger's movement: when is this jogger moving backwards? Split up the time interval from (the start of their run) to (where is the time that the jogger changed direction) to . Calculate the displacements on each of these two intervals.    Calculate the total distance that the jogger traveled in their 3 hour run.   Remember that we're really calculating:       Finding the Future Value of a Function  We can again think back to and build our last result of this section. Remember when we were looking to predict the location of our object at different times: we said it was reasonable to start at our initial position, and then add the displacement of the object from that initial time up to the time that we were interested in. So, to estimate the object's position after 150 seconds, we would calculate: . But we said we could do this to estimate the object's position at any value for time, .   Future Position of an Object   For some object moving along a straight line with velocity and an intitial position of , the future position of the object at some time (with ) is: Note that we change the variable in the velocity function while we integrate: since we want our position function to be in terms of , the ending time point that we calculate the displacement up to, we need to choose a different variable to write velocity in terms of. Mechanically, there is no difference, since we're just swapping out the variables and naming them .    We can note that this relationship between velocity and position can exist in many other context: any pair of functions that are derivatives\/antiderivatives of each other can have this relationship!   Net Change and Future Value   Suppose the value changes over time at a known rate . Then the net change in between and is: . Similarly, given the initial value , the future value of at time is:      "

Let's first consider a volume created using disks or washers.   What Changes (in the Washer Method) with a New Axis?   Let's revisit , and ask some more follow-up questions. First, we'll tinker with the solid we created: instead of revolving around the -axis, let's revolve the same solid around the horizontal line .    What changes, if anything, do you have to make to the rectangle you drew in ?    What changes, if anything, do you have to make to the area of the \"face\" th washer?

Formalizing These Changes in the Washers and Shells   More Shifted Axes   We're going to spend some time constructing several different volume integrals in this activity. We'll consider the same region each time, but make changes to the axis of revolution. For each, we'll want to think about what kind of method we're using (disks\/washers or shells) and how the different axis of revolution gets implemented into our volume integral formulas.  Let's consider the region bounded by the curves and between and .    Let's start with revolving this around the -axis and thinking about the solid formed. While you set up your volume integral, think carefully about which method you'll be using (disks\/washers or shells) as well as which variable you are integrating with regard to ( or ).   Note that in this region, we definitely want to use rectangles that stand up vertically. That means that they'll have a very small width, , and sit perpendicular to the axis of revolution.    Now let's create a different solid by revolving this region around the -axis. Set up a volume integral, and continue to think carefully about which method you'll be using (disks\/washers or shells) as well as which variable you are integrating with regard to ( or ).   We still will use the same tall rectangle with a small side length, but this time it will be parallel to our axis of revolution.    We'll start shifting our axis of revolution now. We'll revolve the same region around the horizontal line to create a solid. Set up an integral expression to calculate the volume.   Note that we're still using the same rectangle (perpendicular to this horizontal axis), and so still integrating with regard to , and using the washer method.   Since in the washer method our function outputs represent the radii, we need to re-measure the distance from our curves to the axis of revolution to find each circle's radius in the washer formula. For a -value on each curve, how do we find the vertical distance down to the line ?    Now revolve the region around the line to create a solid of revolution, and write down the integral representing the volume.   Note, now, that the -value of the axis of revolution is larger than all of the -values on the curves, meaning that to measure the distance from the axis of revolution to the curves, we might measure them in the opposite direction. Also, which curve is further away from the axis of revolution, representing the larger\/outer radius?    Let's change things up. Revolve the region around the vertical line to create a new solid. Set up an integral representing the volume of that solid.   Note that the same rectangle that we used before is standing parallel to our axis of revolution. We're going to change methodology, and use the shell method!   Normally we use the input variable ( in this case) to measure the radius from the rectangles at different -value to the axis of revolution, the -axis. Now, though, we're not looking at the distance from -values to . We're looking to find the radius, the distance from -values in this region to .    We'll do one more solid. Let's revolve this region around the line . Set up an integral representing the volume.   Note that this time, the axis of revolution's -value is larger than all of the -values in our region. So when we subtract to measure the radius, we need to subtract from down to the varying -values in the region.     "
