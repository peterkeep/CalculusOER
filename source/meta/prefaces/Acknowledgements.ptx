        There are several people that I want to thank for their help or contributions to this book. 
    </p>
    <p>
        First, thanks to Dan and Terra in the library at Moraine Valley. They've both been so supportive of the project and worked so hard to make it possible for me to find space and time to actually write the book. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the math department at Moraine Valley, Amy, Angelina, and Lisa all were so helpful in different ways. I'm so thankful for their help with writing and editing practice problems (and solutions) and contributing their expertise to make sure that this is a teaching and learning resource first and foremost. Thanks for agreeing to help and always providing great feedback.
    </p>

        Thank you to the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois (CARLI) and the Illinois State Library for providing the opportunity through grant funding for me to write this. I've been wanting to put this type of resource together for my students for years and had never been able to find a way to carve out the time required. Your support to developing good OER practices and investment in Illinois is so appreciated.

        I've learned so much by digging through the source code of all of your projects. Thanks so much for providing such great projects and offering up your source code for others to learn from.

        And last, thank you to my students. I've loved thinking about calculus with you for so many years, and in every semester, our classes together are the highlight of my job. The way we talk about calculus together has changed over the years for the better, and I'm so thankful for your influence over how I think about calculus and how we can present calculus to people who want to learn it.
