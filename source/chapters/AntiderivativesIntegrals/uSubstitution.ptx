    <introduction>
        <p>
            We have spent some time thinking about integrals, both indefinite and definite integrals, and what they represent. Let's end this discussion of integration with some classifications of indefinite integrals.
        </p>
        <p>
            This classification is completely unserious, but maybe helpful. Let's say that we had to classify each of the following integrals as <kbd>Easy</kbd>, <kbd>Medium</kbd>, or <kbd>Hard</kbd>. Again, these are completely ambiguous and not at all defined, but I hope that we can see the spirit of what we're thinking of. Here are the three integrals that we want to classify:
        </p>
        <sidebyside>
            <p>
                <me>
                    \int x^5\;dx
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    \int \sec^2(x)\;dx
                </me>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                <me>
                    \int \frac{x^3}{1+x^2}\;dx
                </me>
            </p>
        </sidebyside>
        <p>
            Which one could have the <kbd>Easy</kbd>? What about a <kbd>Medium</kbd> difficulty integral? What makes this one a bit harder, but not so hard to be classified as <kbd>Hard</kbd>? Can you even solve the <kbd>Hard</kbd> right now?
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's think about a legitimately difficult integral, but one that we <em>can</em> actually think about.
        </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-UndoChainRule">
        <title>Undoing the Chain Rule</title>
        <p>
            Let's try to formalize this process of "undoing the Chain Rule" that we noticed in <xref ref="act-UndoChainRule"/>. It might be helpful to, first, think about the Chain Rule and how the differentiation process works. Let's look at the differentiating <m>\sin(x^7)</m> using the Chain Rule.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing we should do when finding <m>\ddx{\sin(x^7)}</m> is recognize and identify the composition. We might call <m>x^7</m> the "inside" function, or re-label it as <m>u</m>. Then we know that the Chain Rule will tell us to differentiate the "outside" function with regard to the "inside" function (or <m>u</m> if we re-label things) and then multiply by the derivative of the inside function (or <m>\frac{du}{dx}</m>).
            <md>
                <mrow>\ddx{\sin(\underbrace{x^7}_{u})} \amp =\ddx{\sin(u)}</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = \frac{d}{du}\left(\sin(u)\right)\left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = \cos(u)\ddx{x^7}</mrow>
                <mrow> \amp = \cos(x^7)7x^6</mrow>
            </md>
            From here, we might re-write things to make it look nicer (coefficients look weird when they're not in the front ðŸ˜­) and write:
            <me>
                \ddx{\sin(x^7)}= 7x^6\cos(x^7)
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            When we work through this process backwards, we'll need to identify the "inside" function, but also find the derivative of that "inside" function, <m>\frac{du}{dx}</m>. This derivative gets introduced in the Chain Rule, and so it will have to be picked out when we undo the Chain Rule.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's build this process and go through the integral <m>\displaystyle \int 7x^6\cos(x^7)\;dx</m> from <xref ref="act-UndoChainRule"/>.
        </p>
        <assemblage xml:id="strat-uSubstitution">
            <title>Process for <m>u</m>-Substitution</title>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Identify an "inside" function and/or a "function-derivative pair." We'll label the "inside" function, or the "function" part of the "function-derivative pair," as <m>u</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Example:</em> In our integral <m>\displaystyle\int 7x^6\cos(x^7)\;dx</m> we can see the "inside" function is <m>x^7</m>, and also we have <m>x^7</m> and <m>7x^6</m> as the function-derivative pair. Let <m>u=x^7</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Define the substitution for the differential, <m>du=u'\;dx</m>. We can think about this as a result from knowing that <m>\frac{du}{dx}=u'</m>, or by thinking that a small change in <m>u</m> corresponds with <m>u'</m> multiplied by a small change in <m>dx</m>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Example:</em> In our integral <m>\displaystyle\int 7x^6\cos(x^7)\;dx</m>, we labeled <m>u=x^7</m>. This means that <m>du=7x^6\;dx</m>, since this is the derivative of <m>x^7</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Substitute! Re-write the integral, replacing the parts that you've labeled as <m>u</m> and <m>du</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Example:</em> We can re-write our integral to make this a bit easier to see:
                            <md>
                                <mrow>\int 7x^6\cos(x)\;dx \amp = \int \cos(\underbrace{x^7}_{u})\underbrace{7x^6\;dx}_{du}</mrow>
                                <mrow> \amp = \int \cos(u)\;du</mrow>
                            </md>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Antidifferentiate! We should have an integral that is "written in terms of <m>u</m>," and so we can antidifferentiate the function as if <m>u</m> was our input variable. Notice that what we've done with our substitution is to undo the "multiply by the derivative of the inside function" step of the Chain Rule. Now we can antidifferentiate the "outside" function!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Example:</em> <m>\displaystyle\int\cos(u)\;du = \sin(u)+C</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Substitute "back" to have our antiderivative family written in terms of our original input variable, <m>x</m> in this case. We'll replace <m>u</m> with whatever we had defined our substitution to be in step 1.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Example:</em> We defined <m>u=x^7</m>, so:
                            <me>
                                \sin(u)+C = \sin(x^7)+C
                            </me>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
        </assemblage>
        <p>
            Let's practice this with some more examples.

        <p>
            Let's try to explain a little bit of what is happening. This style of problem solving is really useful in mathematics, and shows up in many places.
        </p>
        <aside>
            <p>
                The first time I saw <xref ref="fig-uSub"/> was in a Differential Equations class. We were learning about Laplace transformations, a technique that is very useful for solving a variety of problems. My professor was explaining why and how Laplace transformations were so powerful, and drew a version of the figure I've included to explain <m>u</m>-substitution. It was so helpful for me to understand what was happening, but the most helpful thing was when the professor said, offhand, "But that's exactly the same type of thing that <m>u</m>-substitution does, too." So many things fell into place for me because of that comment! You are guaranteed to see different versions of this picture throughout this textbook, but you can also keep an eye out for this in different problem-solving techniques in mathematics.

        </figure>
        <p>
            Let's explain what is happening in this picture. First, we typically are presented with integrals in some context. Our goal is to antidifferentiate. So for <m>\displaystyle\int f(x)\;dx</m>, we hope to antidifferentiate and end up with <m>F(x)+C</m>, the family of antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>. These two things (the indefinite integral and the family of antiderivatives) exist in the same context (since they're defined with the same variable). We have spent some time moving directly from <m>\displaystyle f(x)\;dx</m> to <m>F(x)+C</m>. But now we're seeing that this isn't always as direct of a path as we might wish: some integrals are <em>hard</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, we can try to identify what the problem is (in this case, composition) and find some transformation to apply to our integral. We choose a variable substitution, and we translate our integral to a different context (in this case, by writing it in terms of a different variable). In order for us to do this, we ned to define some substitution <m>u</m>, and then translate <m>dx</m> into <m>du</m> using the relationship <m>du=u'\;dx</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we have this new integral, of a different function <m>g(u)</m> in a different context with <m>u</m> acting as the input, we try to antidifferentiate again. If we pick our substitution carefully and we know what kind of problem we're trying to fix (in this case, getting around the composition), then this new integral in the <m>u</m> context could be "easier" to antidifferentiate. So our goal is to antidifferentiate the integral, but we can antidifferentiate it after translating it to a different context.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we have this antiderivative, we can translate that antiderivative family back to the original context (in this case, we write it in terms of <m>x</m>). We do this by utilizing the same translation or substitution that we defined earlier: we have something defined to link <m>u</m> and <m>x</m>. We can notice that, since the object we're translating is not an integral anymore, we do not have a differential to translate.
        </p>
        <p>
            And there we have it: <m>u</m>-substitution works by identifying a problem that makes our task hard, translating our object to a friendlier context based on what we know about our problem, solving the problem in this friendlier context, and then finally translating the solution back to our original context.
        </p>
        <aside>
            <p>
                Doesn't this feel like what we do with <xref ref="sec-LogarithmicDifferentiation" text="title"/>? Use logs to translate our function to a friendlier form, differentiate in the log-context, and then try to translate back by solving for <m>y'</m>?
            </p>

            To see a visualization of what is happening, we can look below: move the slider to see the continuous deformation of the integral as we apply the variable substitution:

        Something we can say is that, since the area doesn't change when we do a variable substitution, then area is <term>invariant</term> under the transformation we're applying with that variable substitution.
