  <title>The Definite Integral</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The big result from our last section on Riemann sums is not just that we can approximate areas by thinking about a bunch of small (thin) rectangles. The big result is that this strategy is scalable: we can increase <m>n</m>, the number of slices/rectangles, and essentially guarantee that, eventually, our approximations will be very accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we move from a concrete process for building rectangles to calculate areas to a more conceptual framework: what happens when <m>n\to \infty</m>?

    <title>Evaluating Areas (Instead of Approximating Them)</title>
    <p>
      Our goal is to move from approximating area to evaluating areas: calculating the real value of the area of these regions bounded between curves and the <m>x</m>-axis.
