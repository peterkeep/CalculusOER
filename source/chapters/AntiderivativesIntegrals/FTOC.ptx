  <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let's remind ourselves of how we interpret derivatives. We are going to repeat a task that we did in <xref ref="act-FDTGraphically" text="type-global-title"/>. It should feel familiar, which is good! We're going to use the intuition to make the big connection we've been forecasting so far.

    <p>
      There it is! The way that we can interpret antiderivatives of functions! We found that the derivative of the function that tells us the signed area trapped between a curve and the <m>x</m>-axis between a fixed starting point and a variable ending point is the curve itself.

      Another way of saying this, though, is that the function that tells us the signed area trapped between a curve and the <m>x</m>-axis between a fixed starting point and a variable ending point is an antiderivative of the curve itself! This is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, or at least half of it.

    <theorem xml:id="thm-FTOC1">
      <title>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 1)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For a function <m>f</m> that is continuous on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>, and a function <m>A(x) = \displaystyle\int_{t=a}^{t=x} f(t)\;dt</m> defined for <m>x</m>-values in <m>[a,b]</m>, then <m>A'(x) = f(x)</m>. That is:
          <me>
            \ddx{\int_{t=a}^{t=x} f(t)\;dt} = f(x)
          </me>.

      <title>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 2)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For a function <m>f(x)</m> continuous on the closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> and some <m>F(x)</m>, an antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> (<m>F'(x)=f(x)</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>), then
          <me>
            \int_{x=a}^{x=b} f(x)\;dx = F(x)\bigg{|}_{x=a}^{x=b} = F(b)-F(a)
