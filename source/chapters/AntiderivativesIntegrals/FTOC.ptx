  <title>The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let's remind ourselves of how we interpret derivatives. We are going to repeat a task that we did in <xref ref="act-FDTGraphically" text="type-global-title"/>. It should feel familiar, which is good! We're going to use the intuition to make the big connection we've been forecasting so far.

    <title>Areas and Antiderivatives</title>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-FTOC1.ptx" />
    <p>
      There it is! The way that we can interpret antiderivatives of functions! We found that the derivative of the function that tells us the signed area trapped between a curve and the <m>x</m>-axis between a fixed starting point and a variable ending point is the curve itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another way of saying this, though, is that the function that tells us the signed area trapped between a curve and the <m>x</m>-axis between a fixed starting point and a variable ending point is an antiderivative of the curve itself! This is the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, or at least half of it.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-FTOC1">
      <title>Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 1)</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For a function <m>f</m> that is continuous on an interval <m>[a,b]</m>, and a function <m>A(x) = \displaystyle\int_{t=a}^{t=x} f(t)\;dt</m> defined for <m>x</m>-values in <m>[a,b]</m>, then <m>A'(x) = f(x)</m>. That is:
          <me>
            \ddx{\int_{t=a}^{t=x} f(t)\;dt} = f(x)
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The proof of this theorem is one of the most delightful proofs we'll see. This is a "connector" theorem: a theorem that brings together several big ideas or objects from one common area of math and links them together. Let's enjoy the proof together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(t)</m> be a function that is continuous on the interval <m>a\leq t\leq b</m>. Then, we'll define the area function as <m>A(x) = \displaystyle \int_{t=a}^{t=x} f(t)\;dt</m> for <m>a\leq x \leq b</m>. We are interested in <m>A'(x)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From <xref ref="def-DerivativeFunction"/>, we know:
          <me>
            A'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{A(x+\Delta x) - A(x)}{\Delta x}\right)
          </me>
          If we just focus on the numerator, <m>A(x+\Delta x) - A(x)</m>, we have:
          <md>
            <mrow> A(x+\Delta x) - A(x)\amp =\left(\int_{t=a}^{t=x+\Delta x} f(t)\;dt\right) - \left(\int_{t=a}^{t=x} f(t)\;dt\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \int_{t=x}^{t=x+\Delta x} f(t)\;dt</mrow>
          </md>
          Let's approximate this integral with a Riemann sum with <m>n=1</m> rectangle.
        </p>
        <figure xml:id="fig-AreaFunction-1">
          <caption></caption>
          <image source="AntiderivativesIntegrals/AreaFunction-1.png" width="90%">
            <shortdescription>Area shaded in under a curve from t=a to t=x, labeled A(x). After this there is a rectangle with width Delta x that touches the curve at some point (x*,f(x*)). The rectangle spans from t=x to t=x + Delta x.</shortdescription>
          </image>
        </figure> 
        <p> 
          The total width of our interval is <m>\Delta x</m>, so we have that 
          <me>
            \int_{t=x}^{t=x+\Delta x} f(t)\;dt \approx f(x^*) \Delta x
          </me>
          where <m>x^*</m> is some <m>x</m>-value in <m>[x, x+\Delta x]</m>. Note that we don't have a sum, as we normally would, since we are only "adding" a single area of a single rectangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is only an approximation of the difference <m>A(x+\Delta x)-A(x)</m>, and so we can say, for small values of <m>\Delta x</m>,
          <md>
            <mrow>A'(x) \amp \approx \left(\frac{A(x+\Delta x) - A(x)}{\Delta x}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>A'(x) \amp \approx \left(\frac{f(x^*)\Delta x}{\Delta x}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>A'(x) \amp \approx f(x^*)</mrow>
          </md>
          All that is left to do is to convince ourselves of two facts:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                This approximation gets better as <m>\Delta x</m> gets smaller, and as <m>\Delta x\to 0</m> we have <m>A'(x)\to f(x^*)</m>.
              </p>
              <figure xml:id="fig-AreaFunction-2">
                <caption></caption>
                <image source="AntiderivativesIntegrals/AreaFunction-2.png" width="90%">
                  <shortdescription>Area shaded in under a curve from t=a to t=x, labeled A(x). After this there is a very thin rectangle that touches the curve at some point (x*,f(x*)). This point looks like it's essentially at the same point as t=x, and the rectangle spans from t=x to some other t value close by, with the label Delta x approaches 0. </shortdescription>
                </image>
              </figure> 
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                As <m>\Delta x\to 0</m>, the options for <m>x^*</m> in <m>[x,x+\Delta x]</m> reduce to just <m>x</m>, since the interval collapses towards the single value. So as <m>\Delta x\to 0</m>, we have <m>x^*\to x</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          To be convinced that <m>A'(x)\to f(x^*)</m>, we just have to rely on the fact that, while our Riemann sum only has <m>n=1</m> rectangle, as <m>\Delta x\to 0</m> the width(s) of "all" of our rectangles (our only one) approach 0, and so we end up with the definition of a definite integral in the limit:
          <md>
            <mrow>\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(x^*)\Delta x \amp = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \sum_{k=1}^1 f(x_k^*) \Delta x </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \int_{t=x}^{t=x+\Delta x} f(t)\;dt</mrow>
          </md>
          Hopefully it is easy to see that <m>x^*\to x</m>, since <m>[x, x+\Delta x]</m> collapses on <m>x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we are convinced of these two facts, then it is clear that <m>A'(x) = f(x)</m>, since:
          <md>
            <mrow>A'(x) \amp =\lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\left(\frac{A(x+\Delta x) - A(x)}{\Delta x}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\left(\frac{f(x^*)\Delta x}{\Delta x}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(x^*)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = f(x)</mrow>
          </md>
          This completes the proof! Most of the proofs that you might see for this theorem use the <xref ref="thm-MVT" text="title"/> to help, since we can see a connection between the derivative <m>A'(x)</m> and the average rate of change of the area function:
          <me>
            \left(\frac{A(x+\Delta x) - A(x)}{\Delta x}\right)
          </me>
          The Mean Value Theorem really is behind many of the most important results in calculus!
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      This theorem is going to be the big result that we use to show how to actually evaluate an area, and so it is easy to think of it as purely support for a "more important" result coming next. But we should pause and think about what this result tells us.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we've done here is come up with a way of:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Guaranteeing that every continuous function has an antiderivative family. We have found a function whose derivative is whatever continuous function we want!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Generating antiderivatives. Until now, we have had to rely on being able to recognize functions as derivatives of other things, or be able to "undo" derivative rules. And this will continue to be an important way for us to antidifferentiate functions. But now we have a way of constructing antiderivatives, albeit weird looking ones<mdash/>we are not yet used to thinking about a function that is defined as a definite integral with a variable ending point.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      We will play with this idea more later (in <xref ref="sec-NetChange"/>), and so for now we will push forward towards our goal of evaluating a definite integral without directly calculating a limit of Riemann sums.

      Phew, this was a lot! Let's sit back a bit and enjoy the fruits of all of this deep, mathematical thinking: we have a relatively straight-forward way of evaluating definite integrals!
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find an antiderivative of the integrand. (Any antiderivative will do, so we can just choose the one with 0 as the constant term!)

        <li>
          <p>
            Evaluate that antiderivative at the end points of the interval we're integrating over, and subtract.
