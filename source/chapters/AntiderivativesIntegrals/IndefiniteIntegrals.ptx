    <title>Antiderivatives and Indefinite Integrals</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We've been spending a lot of time thinking about derivatives! We've done this in a couple of different ways:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We have thought carefully about what derivatives are, what they measure, and how to interpret them.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We have built up a whole list of tools that we can use to actually find or calculate these derivatives. We know how to differentiate most functions (and combinations of functions) that we can think of!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We've been able to apply these derivatives to some specific contexts to solve problems or analyze functions and mathematical models.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Let's think about derivatives in a slightly different way!
        </p>
        <xi:include href="./activities/act-FindFunction.ptx" />
        <p>
            We've done two things here: thought about how we might "undo" differnentiation, and discovered a nice property about constants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that we've already discovered this rule! We proved it, back when we were playing with the <xref ref="thm-MVT" text="title"/>. We built a related theorem that showed that two functions can have the same derivative, and if they do then they are off by, at most, a constant: <xref ref="thm-OffByConstant" text="type-global-title"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's visualize this phenomena!

            We want to try to define and name these "backwards derivatives." Instead of calling them the "negative first" derivative, we will name them as <term>antiderivatives</term>.

                        We won't be undoing the Power Rule with either of these! We might try to think about functions whose derivatives are <m>\frac{1}{x}</m> and <m>\frac{1}{1+x^2}</m>.

                        We use absolute values in the logarithm because we want to find a functions whose derivative is <m>g(x)</m> on the whole interval that <m>g(x)</m> is defined. The log function is only defined for positive inputs, but we would like to be able put any non-zero input into our function (since that's the domain of <m>g</m>).

        <p>
            We call this type of problem an "initial value problem." Here, we ended up solving for a family of antiderivatives, but then using some more information about that antiderivative (in this case, information about file size and time) to find the specific antiderivative function that was relevant.

                For some function <m>f(x)</m>, if we want to find an antiderivative function <m>F(x)</m> and we know some "initial value," <m>F(a)</m>, then we can find the exact antiderivative by:

            To finish this out, we'll just build some notation that represents these families of antiderivatives. We can use words to describe them, but it will be helpful to introduce some quick way of writing this using notation.

            These should all be very familiar, since they are really just restatements of the results from <xref ref="sec-DerivativeRules" text="type-global-title"/>.

        <p>
            We should also be comfortable recognizing derivatives of functions that we know, in order to find more functions that we can antidifferentiate.
