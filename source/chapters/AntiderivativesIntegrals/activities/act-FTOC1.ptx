    <title>Interpreting Area</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            First, we're going to define a bit of a weird function. Sometimes it's called the <term>Area function</term>:
            <me>
                A(x)=\int_{t=0}^{t=x} g(t)\;dt
            </me>.
            This is a strange function, because we're defining the function as an integral of another function. Specifically, note that the <em>input</em> for our area function <m>A(x)</m> is the ending limit of integration: we're calculating the signed area "under" the curve of <m>g(t)</m> from <m>t=0</m> up to some variable ending point <m>t=x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can visualize this function by looking at the areas we create as we change <m>x</m>. For now, get used to just seeing the area "under" <m>g</m> when we move the point around. The areas themselves are the outputs of the function <m>A(x)</m>.
        </p>
        <interactive platform="doenetml" width="95%" aspect="1:1.3">

                <xi:include parse="text" href="../doenet/FTOC-2.xml"/>
            </slate>
        </interactive>
        <p>
            Now we can think about this area function, and try to connect it to the graph of <m>g(t)</m>.

                List the intervals on which <m>A(x)</m> is increasing. What about decreasing?

                Compare your answers here to your answers about the behavior of <m>f(x)</m> based on the (same) graph of <m>f'(x)</m> in <xref ref="act-InterpretDerivative"/>.

            <p>
                What does this mean about the connection between areas and derivatives, or areas and antiderivatives?
