    <title>Compare Two Integrals</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's compare two integrals, and use this to build a more general strategy for performing <m>u</m>-substitution.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider the following integral:
                <me>
                    \int -4x^3\sec^2(1-x^4)\;dx
                </me>
                Select and justify a choice for <m>u</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Where is the composition? Do you see a function-derivative pair?
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Perform the <m>u</m>-substitution and antidifferentiate, and then substitute back to write your antiderivative in terms of <m>x</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                We'll let <m>u=1-x^4</m>, and so <m>du = -4x^3\;dx</m>.
                <md>
                    <mrow>\int -4x^3\sec^2(1-x^4)\;dx \amp = \int \sec^2(\underbrace{1-x^4}_{u})\underbrace{(-4x^3)\;dx}_{du} </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \int \sec^2(u)\;du</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \tan(u)+C</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \tan(1-x^4)+C</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
        </solution>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Compare that integral to this one:
                <me>
                    \int x^3\sec^2(1-x^4)\;dx
                </me>
                What is different about this new integral? What has remained the same? How does that impact your choice for <m>u</m>, or <em>does</em> it impact your choice for <m>u</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Notice that nothing has changed about the <q>inside</q> function!
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Has that changed what <m>du</m> should be? 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Remember that <m>du=u'\;dx</m>. If we didn't change our selection of <m>u</m>, then shouldn't <m>du</m> remain the same as well?
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Ok, so we've noticed an issue here. There are <em>plenty</em> of good ways of solving this problem, where <m>du</m> doesn't <q>show up</q> perfectly in our integral. In this case, we have that we're missing a necessary coefficient. We have the <m>x^3</m> part, but we are missing the <m>-4</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try to rewrite our integral with a <m>-4</m> coefficient in there. We'll do that by multiplying the integrand function by <m>1</m>, disguised as <m>\frac{-4}{-4}</m> or <m>\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right)(-4)</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>

            <p>
                <md>
                    <mrow>\int x^3\sec^2(1-x^4)\;dx \amp = \int {\color{red}{\left(-\frac{1}{4}\right)(-4)}}x^3\sec^2(1-x^4)\;dx </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = {\color{red}{-\frac{1}{4}}}\int {\color{red}{-4}}x^3\sec^2(1-x^4)\;dx</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Now we can use the same <m>u</m>-substitution as before, and integrate in a similar way! Notice, though, that we will retain the coefficient of <m>-\frac{1}{4}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                (This should be reasonable: our integral is <m>-\frac{1}{4}</m> of the original one, since our coefficient was <m>1</m> to the original's <m>-4</m>.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Go ahead and integrate!

                <me>
                    \int x^3\sec^2(1-x^4)\;dx = -\frac{1}{4}\tan(1-x^4)+C
