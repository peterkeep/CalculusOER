    <title>Visualizing the Average Height of a Function</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We are going to build a formula to find the "average height" or "average value" of a function <m>f(x)</m> on the interval <m>[a,b]</m>. We're going to look at a function and try to find the average height. Along the way, we'll think a bit about areas!
        </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider the following function. Find the average height of the function on the interval pictured!

        <statement>
            <p>
                How does the area "under" the curve <m>f(x)</m> on the interval compare to the area of the rectangle formed by the average height line?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                How do you define the two areas? 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                One of these is the area under <m>f(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>, which we can use calculus for!
            </p>
            <p>
                The other is the area of a rectangle with a height (the average height of <m>f(x)</m>) and a width (the width of the interval).
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Set up an equation connecting the two areas, and solve for the average height of <m>f(x)</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                If <m>\text{area} = \text{height}\times\text{width}</m>, then doesn't it make sense that <m>\text{height} = \dfrac{\text{area}}{\text{width}}</m>? How, then, do we find average height by dividing an area and a width?
