    <title>Weird Areas - Part 2</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to think about the same region, kind of.

                <shortdescription>A graph of the linear function f(x)=4-3x. The points (0,4) and (3,-5) are marked, and the region between the curve and the axis is shaded in. This shape makes two triangles, one above the axis and one below it, since the line crosses the x-axis.</shortdescription>

            Let's think about the same linear function, <m>f(x)=4-3x</m>, but this time we'll approximate and evaluate the area bounded between <m>f(x)</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis from <m>x=3</m> to <m>x=0</m>:
            <me>
                \int_{x=3}^{x=0}(4-3x)\;dx
            </me>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Use geometry to calculate the area. Compare this to the result from <xref ref="act-WeirdAreas"/>.

                Let's approximate this using a Riemann sum. Calculate <m>M_3</m>, the Midpoint Riemann sum with <m>n=3</m> rectangles.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You're going to divide up the interval from <m>x=3</m> to <m>x=0</m> into 3 subintervals: <m>[3,2]</m>, <m>[2,1]</m>, and <m>[1,2]</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you're picking the middle <m>x</m>-value from each subinterval (<m>x_1^* = \frac{1}{2}</m>, <m>x_2^* = \frac{3}{2}</m>, and <m>x_3^*={5}{2}</m>) to plug into <m>f(x)</m> in order to find the heights of your rectangles.
            </p>
            <p>
                If <m>\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}</m> and <m>a=3</m>, <m>b=0</m>, and <m>n=3</m>, then what value do we use for the widths, <m>\Delta x</m>?

                Do you need to go back and recalculate the area geometrically (from the first part of this activity)? Explain why your answer for <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=3}^{x=0}(4-3x)\;dx</m> <em>should</em> be positive, based on the Riemann sums we calculated.
