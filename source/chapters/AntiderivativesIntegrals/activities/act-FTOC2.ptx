    <title>Evaluating Areas and Antiderivatives</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this short activity, we'll just collect information about antiderivatives and this new area function,
            <me>
                A(x)=\int_{t=a}^{t=x} f(t)\;dt
            </me>
            for a function <m>f(t)</m> that is continuous on the interval <m>a\leq t\leq x</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For our purposes in this activity, let's say that <m>f(x)=x+\cos(x)</m>.
        </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                From the <xref ref="thm-FTOC1" text="title"/>, we know that <m>A(x)</m> is an antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>, since <m>A'(x)=f(x)</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write out the function <m>A(x)</m>, and then name/write out one <em>other</em> antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m>, some <m>F(x)</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                <m>\displaystyle A(x)= \int_{t=a}^{t=x} t+\cos(t)\;dt</m>, and for <m>F(x)</m> you can use your antidifferentiation rules from <xref ref="sec-IndefiniteIntegrals" text="type-global-title"/>.
            </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                We know that all of the antiderivatives of a function are connected to each other. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Describe the connection between <m>A(x)</m> and your <m>F(x)</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                This is the result that we proved in <xref ref="thm-OffByConstant"/> and used to define a <term>family of antiderivatives</term> in <xref ref="def-Antiderivative"/>.

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What is the value of <m>A(a)</m>? What is the value of <m>F(a)</m>? How are they different from each other?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                <me>
                    A(a) = \int_{t=a}^{t=a} f(t)\;dt = 0
                </me>
                For <m>F(a)</m>, you can evaluate your antiderivative at <m>x=a</m>. The important part is thinking about how these two values are different from each other.

        <statement>
            <p>
                What is the value of <m>A(b)</m>? What is the value of <m>F(b)</m>? How are they different from each other?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>    
            <p>
                <me>
                    A(b) = \int_{t=a}^{t=b} f(t)\;dt
                </me>
                For <m>F(a)</m>, you can evaluate your antiderivative at <m>x=b</m>. The important part is thinking about how these two values are different from each other. Is the difference between these values the same, or different from the difference between <m>A(a)</m> and <m>F(a)</m>?

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What about the differences: <m>A(b)-A(a)</m> compared to <m>F(b)-F(a)</m>? 
            </p>

                It is worth noting that:
                <md>
                    <mrow>A(b)-A(a) \amp = A(b)-0</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \int_{t=a}^{t=b} f(t)\;dt</mrow>
