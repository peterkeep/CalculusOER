    <title>Find a Function Where...</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            For each of the following derivatives, find a function <m>f(x)</m> whose first (or second) derivative matches the listed derivative.

                <m>f'(x)=4x^3 + 6</m>

                <m>f''(x)=e^x - \dfrac{1}{\sqrt[3]{x}}</m>

                Go back through each of the above derivatives, and find a different option for <m>f(x)</m> that still works. Make sure that it is something completely unique, and not just an equivalent function that is written differently.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why are able to find multiple answers in these questions, but not when we are given a function and need to find a derivative?
