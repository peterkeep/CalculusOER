    <title>Weird Areas</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's think about a simple linear function, <m>f(x)=4-3x</m>. We'll both approximate and evaluate the area bounded between <m>f(x)</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=3</m>:
            <me>
                \int_{x=0}^{x=3}(4-3x)\;dx
            </me>

            <p>
                Explain why we do not need to think about Riemann sums in order for us to calculate the shaded in area. How would you calculate this without using calculus?
            </p>
            <p>
                Calculate the area!
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Are there some shapes that you recognize? What are the dimensions of these shapes?

        <statement>
            <p>
                Let's approximate this area using a Riemann sum. Calculate <m>L_3</m>, the Left Riemann sum with <m>n=3</m> rectangles.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You're going to divide up the interval from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=3</m> into 3 subintervals: <m>[0,1]</m>, <m>[1,2]</m>, and <m>[2,3]</m>. Note that <m>\Delta x=1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you're picking the left-most <m>x</m>-value from each subinterval (<m>x_1^* = 0</m>, <m>x_2^* = 1</m>, and <m>x_3^*=2</m>) to plug into <m>f(x)</m> in order to find the heights of your rectangles.
            </p>
        </hint>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let's approximate this area a second time, but with a different selection strategy for our <m>x</m>-values. Calculate <m>R_3</m>, the Right Riemann sum with <m>n=3</m> rectangles.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You're still going to divide up the interval from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=3</m> into 3 subintervals: <m>[0,1]</m>, <m>[1,2]</m>, and <m>[2,3]</m>. We still have <m>\Delta x=1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you're picking the right-most <m>x</m>-value from each subinterval (<m>x_1^* = 1</m>, <m>x_2^* = 2</m>, and <m>x_3^*=3</m>) to plug into <m>f(x)</m> in order to find the heights of your rectangles.

                Compare your answers for <m>L_3</m> and <m>R_3</m>. They should be <em>very</em> different. Why? What is happening that makes <m>R_3</m> specifically such a weird value?

        <statement>
            <p>
                Do you need to go back and re-calculate the area geometrically (from the first part of this activity)? Explain why your answer for <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^{x=3}(4-3x)\;dx</m> <em>should</em> be negative, based on the Riemann sums we calculated.
            </p>

            <p>
                Did you account for "negative" area in the second trianglular region in this integral?

                Find a value <m>x=b</m> such that:
                <me>
                    \int_{x=0}^{x=b}(4-3x)\;dx=0
                </me>.

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Find a <em>different</em> value <m>x=b</m> such that:
                <me>
                    \int_{x=0}^{x=b}(4-3x)\;dx=0
                </me>.
                Is there a second way of making this area 0?

                Depending on what you did earlier, you might have to find some ending <m>x</m>-value that "balances" the area above and below the <m>x</m>-axis. If you already did this, then you might have to find an ending <m>x</m>-value that collapses this shape down to a 1-dimensional shape with no area.
