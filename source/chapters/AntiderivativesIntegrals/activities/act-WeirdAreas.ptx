        <p>
            Let's think about a simple linear function, <m>f(x)=4-3x</m>. We'll both approximate and evaluate the area bounded between <m>f(x)</m> and the <m>x</m>-axis from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=3</m>:

                    <shortdescription>A graph of the linear function f(x)=4-3x. The points (0,4) and (3,-5) are marked, and the region between the curve and the axis is shaded in. This shape makes two triangles, one above the axis and one below it, since the line crosses the x-axis.</shortdescription>

            <p>
                Explain why we do not need to think about Riemann sums in order for us to calculate the shaded in area. How would you calculate this without using calculus?
            </p>
            <p>
                Calculate the area!
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Are there some shapes that you recognize? What are the dimensions of these shapes?

                Let's approximate this area using a Riemann sum. Calculate <m>L_3</m>, the Left Riemann sum with <m>n=3</m> rectangles.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You're going to divide up the interval from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=3</m> into 3 subintervals: <m>[0,1]</m>, <m>[1,2]</m>, and <m>[2,3]</m>. Note that <m>\Delta x=1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you're picking the left-most <m>x</m>-value from each subinterval (<m>x_1^* = 0</m>, <m>x_2^* = 1</m>, and <m>x_3^*=2</m>) to plug into <m>f(x)</m> in order to find the heights of your rectangles.
            </p>
        </hint>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let's approximate this area a second time, but with a different selection strategy for our <m>x</m>-values. Calculate <m>R_3</m>, the Right Riemann sum with <m>n=3</m> rectangles.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You're still going to divide up the interval from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=3</m> into 3 subintervals: <m>[0,1]</m>, <m>[1,2]</m>, and <m>[2,3]</m>. We still have <m>\Delta x=1</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you're picking the right-most <m>x</m>-value from each subinterval (<m>x_1^* = 1</m>, <m>x_2^* = 2</m>, and <m>x_3^*=3</m>) to plug into <m>f(x)</m> in order to find the heights of your rectangles.

                Compare your answers for <m>L_3</m> and <m>R_3</m>. They should be <em>very</em> different. Why? What is happening that makes <m>R_3</m> specifically such a weird value?

            <p>
                Do you need to go back and re-calculate the area geometrically (from the first part of this activity)? Explain why your answer for <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^{x=3}(4-3x)\;dx</m> <em>should</em> be negative, based on the Riemann sums we calculated.

        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Did you account for <q>negative</q> area in the second trianglular region in this integral?

                Find a value <m>x=b</m> such that:
                <me>
                    \int_{x=0}^{x=b}(4-3x)\;dx=0
                </me>.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Find a <em>different</em> value <m>x=b</m> such that:
                <me>
                    \int_{x=0}^{x=b}(4-3x)\;dx=0
                </me>.
                Is there a second way of making this area 0?

                Depending on what you did earlier, you might have to find some ending <m>x</m>-value that <q>balances</q> the area above and below the <m>x</m>-axis. If you already did this, then you might have to find an ending <m>x</m>-value that collapses this shape down to a 1-dimensional shape with no area.
