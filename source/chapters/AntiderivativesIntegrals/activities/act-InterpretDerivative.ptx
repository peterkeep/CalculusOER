    <title>Interpreting the Graph of a Derivarive</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's look at a picture of a graph of the first derivative, <m>f'(x)</m>, and try to get some information about <m>f(x)</m> from it. Use the following graph of <m>f'(x)</m>, the first derivative, to answer the questions about <m>f(x)</m>.

        <p>
            Since we don't have a huge amount of detail, you'll likely have to estimate the <m>x</m>-values for intervals and points in the following questions, but that's ok! Estimate away! Just make sure you know what you're looking for in the graph of <m>f'(x)</m> to answer these questions.

                List the intervals on which <m>f(x)</m> is increasing. What about decreasing?
