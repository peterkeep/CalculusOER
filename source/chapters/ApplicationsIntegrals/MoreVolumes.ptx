  <title>More Volumes: Shifting the Axis of Revolution</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have introduced some methods for creating and calculating the volume of different 3 dimensional solids of revolution.

    <title>What Changes?</title>
    <p>
      Let's first consider a volume created using disks or washers.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-VolumesWhatChanges-Washers.ptx" />
    <p>
      Now let's consider a volume created using shells.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-VolumesWhatChanges-Shells.ptx" />
    <p>
      In both of these cases, we can notice that the only changes we make are to the <em>radii</em>: we just need to re-measure the distance from axis of revolution to either the ends of the rectangle (in the washer method) or the side of the rectangle (in the shell method).
