  <title>More Volumes: Shifting the Axis of Revolution</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have introduced some methods for creating and calculating the volume of different 3 dimensional solids of revolution.

    <title>What Changes?</title>
    <p>
      Let's first consider a volume created using disks or washers.

    <p>
      Now let's consider a volume created using shells.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-VolumesWhatChanges-Shells.ptx" />
    <p>
      In both of these cases, we can notice that the only changes we make are to the <em>radii</em>: we just need to remeasure the distance from axis of revolution to either the ends of the rectangle (in the washer method) or the side of the rectangle (in the shell method).

      We can look at yet another interactive graph (similar to how we ended <xref ref="sec-AreaBetweenCurves" text="type-global-title"/> and <xref ref="sec-VolumesOfRevolution" text="type-global-title"/>). This time, we'll think about how our axis of revolution as well as our choice of rectangle orientation impacts how we construct the washers or shells.

      </slate>
    </interactive>
    <p>
      Notice that in each case, we're remeasuring the radius! Whether we're measuring the radii of a washer by thinking about how far the function outputs are away from the axis of revolution or if we're measuring the radius of a shell by thinking about how far the input variable is away from the axis of revolution, we need to rethink this and do some subtraction.
