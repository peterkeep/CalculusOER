    <title>More Shifted Axes</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to spend some time constructing <em>several</em> different volume integrals in this activity. We'll consider the same region each time, but make changes to the axis of revolution. For each, we'll want to think about what kind of method we're using (disks/washers or shells) and how the different axis of revolution gets implemented into our volume integral formulas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's consider the region bounded by the curves <m>y=\cos(x)+3</m> and <m>y=\dfrac{x}{2}</m> between <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2\pi</m>.

                Let's start with revolving this around the <m>x</m>-axis and thinking about the solid formed. While you set up your volume integral, think carefully about which method you'll be using (disks/washers or shells) as well as which variable you are integrating with regard to (<m>x</m> or <m>y</m>).

        <hint>
            <p>
                Note that in this region, we definitely want to use rectangles that stand up vertically. That means that they'll have a very small width, <m>\Delta x</m>, and sit perpendicular to the axis of revolution.

                Now let's create a different solid by revolving this region around the <m>y</m>-axis. Set up a volume integral, and continue to think carefully about which method you'll be using (disks/washers or shells) as well as which variable you are integrating with regard to (<m>x</m> or <m>y</m>). 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                We still will use the same tall rectangle with a small <m>\Delta x</m> side length, but this time it will be parallel to our axis of revolution.
            </p>

        <statement>

                We'll start shifting our axis of revolution now. We'll revolve the same region around the horizontal line <m>y=-1</m> to create a solid. Set up an integral expression to calculate the volume.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Note that we're still using the same rectangle (perpendicular to this horizontal axis), and so still integrating with regard to <m>x</m>, and using the washer method.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since in the washer method our function outputs represent the radii, we need to remeasure the distance from our curves to the axis of revolution to find each circle's radius in the washer formula. For a <m>y</m>-value on each curve, how do we find the vertical distance down to the line <m>y=-1</m>?

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Now revolve the region around the line <m>y=5</m> to create a solid of revolution, and write down the integral representing the volume.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Note, now, that the <m>y</m>-value of the axis of revolution is larger than all of the <m>y</m>-values on the curves, meaning that to measure the distance from the axis of revolution to the curves, we might measure them in the opposite direction. Also, which curve is further away from the axis of revolution, representing the larger/outer radius?

        <statement>

                Let's change things up. Revolve the region around the vertical line <m>x=-1</m> to create a new solid. Set up an integral representing the volume of that solid.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Note that the same rectangle that we used before is standing parallel to our axis of revolution. We're going to change methodology, and use the shell method!
            </p>

        <hint>
            <p>
                Normally we use the input variable (<m>x</m> in this case) to measure the radius from the rectangles at different <m>x</m>-value to the axis of revolution, the <m>y</m>-axis. Now, though, we're not looking at the distance from <m>x</m>-values to <m>x=0</m>. We're looking to find the radius, the distance from <m>x</m>-values in this region to <m>x=-1</m>.
            </p>
        </hint>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                We'll do one more solid. Let's revolve this region around the line <m>x=7</m>. Set up an integral representing the volume.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Note that this time, the axis of revolution's <m>x</m>-value is larger than all of the <m>x</m>-values in our region. So when we subtract to measure the radius, we need to subtract from <m>x=7</m> down to the varying <m>x</m>-values in the region.
