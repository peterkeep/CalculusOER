    <title>Volume by Shells</title>

        <p>
            Let's consider the region bounded by the curves <m>y=x^3</m> and <m>y-x+6</m> as well as the line <m>y=0</m>. You might remember this region from <xref ref="act-SingleIntegral"/>. This time, we'll create a 3-dimensional solid by revolving the region around the <m>x</m>-axis

            <p>
                Sketch one or two rectangles that are <em>perpendicular</em> to the <m>x</m>-axis. Then set up an integral expression to find the volume of the solid using them.

            <p>
                Note that in this context, we're actually using disks and washers. Also note that the bottom of the rectangles are bounded by <m>y=0</m> from <m>x=-6</m> to <m>x=0</m> and then switches to being bounded by <m>y=x^3</m> from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=2</m>.

                Now draw a single rectangle in the region that is <em>parallel</em> to the axis of revolution. Use this rectangle to visualize the <m>k</m>th slice of this 3-dimensional solid. What does that single rectangle create when it is revolved around the <m>x</m>-axis?

        <hint>
            <p>
                This won't create a disk or washer! We'll have to change variables, and try to see how we can create a shell.

                Confirm that your volumes are the same, no matter your approach to setting it up.
