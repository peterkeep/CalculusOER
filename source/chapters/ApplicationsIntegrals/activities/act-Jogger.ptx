    <introduction>
        <p>
            Consider a jogger running along a straight-line path, where their velocity at <m>t</m> hours is <m>v(t)=2t^2-8t+6</m>, and velocity is measured in miles per hour. We begin observing this jogger at <m>t=0</m> and observe them over a course of 3 hours.

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                When is the jogger's acceleration equal to 0 mi/hr<m>^2</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Solve <m>a(t) = v'(t) = 0</m>.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Does this time represent a maximum or minimum velocity for the jogger?
