    <title>What Changes (in the Washer Method) with a New Axis?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's revisit <xref ref="act-VolumesDisksWashers" text="type-global-title" />, and ask some more follow-up questions. First, we'll tinker with the solid we created: instead of revolving around the <m>x</m>-axis, let's revolve the same solid around the horizontal line <m>y=-3</m>.
