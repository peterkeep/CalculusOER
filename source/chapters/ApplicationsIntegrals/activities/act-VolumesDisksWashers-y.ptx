    <title>Another Volume</title>

        <p>
            Now let's consider another region: this time, the one bounded between the curves <m>y=x</m> and <m>y=3\sqrt{x}</m>. We will, again, create a 3-dimensional solid by revolving this region around the <m>y</m>-axis.

                    Graph of the region bounded between the root function y=3sqrt(x) and the line y=x. The curves intersect at (0,0) and at (9,9), and the root defines the top of the region. The whole region is above the x-axis.

                Visualize the solid you'll create when you revolve this region around the <m>y</m>-axis.

            <p>
                Draw a single rectangle in your region standing perpendicular to the <m>y</m>-axis.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Notice that your rectangle is sitting on its side now! This will change some things for us in a familiar way!

            <p>
                Let's use this rectangle to visualize the <m>k</m>th slice of this 3-dimensional solid. What does the "face" of it look like?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                It should be a circle within a circle like in <xref ref="fig-Washers-5"/>, but can you be more detailed with labeling the radii?
            </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Find the area of the face of the <m>k</m>th slice.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Note that this is a 2-dimensional shape, and we're just finding the area of it. You'll also notice that the radii are measuring a horizontal distance in terms of a differing height, so you'll want to express these as functions of <m>y</m>.
            </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The outer radius comes from the function <m>y=x</m>, but we'll invert it to be <m>x=y</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The inner radius comes from the function <m>y=3\sqrt{x}</m>, but we'll invert it be written as <m>x=\left(\dfrac{y}{3}\right)^2</m> or <m>x=\dfrac{y^2}{9}</m>.
                <me>
                    A(y_k^*) = \pi\left((y_k^*)^2 - \left(\frac{(y_k^*)^2}{9}\right)^2\right)
