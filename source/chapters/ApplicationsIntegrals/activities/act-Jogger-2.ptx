    <title>Tracking our Jogger</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's revisit our jogger from <xref ref="act-Jogger"/>.

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Calculate the total displacement of the jogger from <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=3</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Set up and evaluate a definite integral here, using the velocity function.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Think back to our descroption of the jogger's movement: when is this jogger moving backwards? Split up the time interval from <m>t=0</m> (the start of their run) to <m>t=c</m> (where <m>c</m> is the time that the jogger changed direction) to <m>t=3</m>. Calculate the displacements on each of these two intervals. 
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Calculate the total distance that the jogger traveled in their 3 hour run.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Remember that we're really calculating: 
                <me>\left\vert \int_{t=0}^{t=c} v(t)\;dt\right\vert + \left\vert \int_{t=c}^{t=3} v(t)\;dt\right\vert</me>
            </p>
