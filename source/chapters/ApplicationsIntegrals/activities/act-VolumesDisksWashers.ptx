            Consider the region bounded between the curves <m>y=4+2x-x^2</m> and <m>y=\dfrac{4}{x+1}</m>. We will create a 3-dimensional solid by revolving this region around the <m>x</m>-axis.

                Let's use this rectangle to visualize the <m>k</m>th slice of this 3-dimensional solid. What does the "face" of it look like?

                It should be a circle within a circle like in <xref ref="fig-Washers-5"/>, but can you be more detailed with labeling the radii?

                Note that this is a 2-dimensional shape, and we're just finding the area of it.

                <m>A(x_k^*) = \pi\left((4+2x_k^*-(x_k^*)^2)^2 - \left(\frac{4}{x_k^*+1}\right)^2\right)</m>

                The sum is going to be adding up all of the areas multiplied by <m>\Delta x</m>. What will that look like in the integral?

                Can you describe how you would antidifferentiate and evaluate this integral?

                What happens when you square these functions? What kinds of strategies will you use for the types of functions you're left with?
            </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The first function, the quadratic, will be annoying to square. We'll end up with some big degree 4 polynomial, though, and antidifferentiating will be easy, since we can use the Power Rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second function squared will give us <m>\dfrac{4}{(x+1)^2}</m>. We can use a <m>u</m>-substitution here with <m>u=x+1</m>. Then, we have a negative exponent and we can use the Power Rule!
