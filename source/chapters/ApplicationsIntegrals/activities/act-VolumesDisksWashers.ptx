            Consider the region bounded between the curves <m>y=4+2x-x^2</m> and <m>y=\dfrac{4}{x+1}</m>. Will will create a 3-dimensional solid by revolving this region around the <m>x</m>-axis.

                Let's use this rectangle to visualize the <m>k</m>th slice of this 3-dimensional solid. What does the "face" of it look like?

            <p>
                It should be a circle within a circle like in <xref ref="fig-Washers-5"/>, but can you be more detailed with labeling the radii?

                Note that this is a 2-dimensional shape, and we're just finding the area of it.

                <m>A(x_k^*) = \pi\left((4+2x_k^*-(x_k^*)^2)^2 - \left(\frac{4}{x_k^*+1}\right)^2\right)</m>

            <p>
                The sum is going to be adding up all of the areas multiplied by <m>\Delta x</m>. What will that look like in the integral?

                Can you describe how you would antidifferentiate and evaluate this integral? 
            </p>

        <hint>

                What happens when you square these functions? What kinds of strategies will you use for the types of functions you're left with?
            </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
            <p>
                The first function, the quadratic, will be annoying to square. We'll end up with some big degree 4 polynomial, though, and antidifferentiating will be easy, since we can use the power rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second function squared will give us <m>\dfrac{4}{(x+1)^2}</m>. We can use a <m>u</m>-substitution here with <m>u=x+1</m>. Then we have a negative exponent and we can use more power rule!
