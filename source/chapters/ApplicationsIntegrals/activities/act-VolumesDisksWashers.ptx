    <introduction>
        <p>
            Consider the region bounded between the curves <m>y=4+2x-x^2</m> and <m>y=\dfrac{4}{x+1}</m>. Will will create a 3-dimensional solid by revolving this region around the <m>x</m>-axis.
        </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Visualize the solid you'll create when you revolve this region around the <m>x</m>-axis.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Draw a single rectangle in your region, standing perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-axis.

                Let's use this rectangle to visualize the <m>k</m>th slice of this 3-dimensional solid. What does the "face" of it look like?

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Find the area of the face of the <m>k</m>th slice. 
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Note that this is a 2-dimensional shape, and we're just finding the area of it.

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Set up, and evaluate, the integral representing the volume of the solid.
