      <p>
        We're observing an object traveling back and forth in a straight line. Throughout a 5 minute interval, we get the following information about the velocity (in feet/second) of the object.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Describe the motion of the object in general.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          How do we interpret the different values of velocity? How do we interpret the sign of velocity? What about how velocity changes from one of the 30-second time points to the next?
        </p>
      </hint>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          When was the acceleration of the object the greatest? When was it the least?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          You can decide how to interpret the "least" acceleration: it is either where the acceleration is closes to 0, or it is the most negative value of the acceleration. These are interpreted differently, but it's a bit ambiguous what we might mean when we say "least acceleration."

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Estimate the total displacement of the object over the 5 minute interval. What is the overall change in posistion from the start to the end?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          How do we use velocity and some time interval to estimate the distance traveled? How do we estimate/assume the velocity on each 30-second time interval?
        </p>
      </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Is this different than the total distance that the object traveled over the 5 minute interval? Why or why not?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          How do we think about (or ignore) the direction of the object? Why is this important here?
        </p>
      </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If we know the initial position of the object, how could we find the posistion of the object at some time, $t$, where $t$ is a multiple of 30 between 0 and 300?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Can we limit the time intervals that we use to calculate the object's displacement? How do we use displacement and a starting point to find an ending point?
