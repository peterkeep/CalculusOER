    <title>What Changes (in the Shell Method) with a New Axis?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's revisit <xref ref="act-VolumesShells" text="type-global-title"/>, and ask some more follow-up questions about the shell method. Again, we'll tinker with the solid we created: instead of revolving around the <m>x</m>-axis, let's revolve the same solid around the horizontal line <m>y=9</m>.

                What changes, if anything, do you have to make to the rectangle you drew in <xref ref="act-VolumesShells"/>?
