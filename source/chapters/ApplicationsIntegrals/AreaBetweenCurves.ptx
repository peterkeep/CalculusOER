            This activity hopefully reminds of the definition of a Riemann Sum (<xref ref="def-RiemannSum"/>) from earlier in this text (<xref ref="sec-RiemannSums"/>).

        We can re-write our definition of the area between curves (<xref ref="def-AreaBetweenCurves"/>) to account for this change in perspective, by thinking about these same functions in terms of <m>y</m>.
