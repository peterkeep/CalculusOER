        <p>
            We say that the volume of a solid can be thought of as <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=a}^{x=b}A(x)\;dx</m> where <m>A(x)</m> is a function describing the cross-sectional area of our solid at an <m>x</m>-value between <m>x=a</m> and <m>x=b</m>. Explain how this integral formula gets built, referencing the slice-and-sum (Riemann sum) method.

            When do we integrate with regard to <m>x</m> (using a <m>dx</m> in our integral and writing our functions with <m>x</m>-value inputs) and when do we integrate with regard to <m>y</m> (using a <m>dy</m> in our integral and writing our functions with <m>y</m>-value inputs) when we're finding volumes using disks and washers? How do we know?

                For each of the following solids, set up an integral expression using either the disk/washer method or the shell method. You don't need to evaluate them, but you should do some careful thinking about how you set these up, especially as you choose between methods and what variable you are integrating with.
