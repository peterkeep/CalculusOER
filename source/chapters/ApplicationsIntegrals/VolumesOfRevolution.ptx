  <title>Volumes of Solids of Revolution</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Hopefully by now we're feeling pretty comfortable with the use of a Riemann sum to create an integral formula. So far, these integral formulas have matched with our intuition somewhat. We can probably justify the integral formula for displacement of an object (<xref ref="def-displacement" text="type-global-title"/>) by thinking about the fact that position is an antiderivative of velocity. We can probably convince ourselves about the integral formula for the area between curves (<xref ref="def-AreaBetweenCurves" text="type-global-title"/>) by thinking about subtracting areas, geometrically.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're going to make a jump from a 2-dimensional measurement of size, area, to a 3-dimensional measurement of size, volume.
    </p>

    <title>From Area To Volume</title>
    <p>
      Here's the basic idea, in a broad overview: if we want to calculate a volume, then we are going to be working with a 3-dimensional solid. We'll use the slice-and-sum process:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Slice the object into uniformly thick slices along some axis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For each slice, we'll approximate the volume. We can do this by thinking about the cross-sectional area. If we assume that the area is constant all the way through the slice (in the same way that we assumed earlier that the heights of our rectangles were constant), then we can simply multiply the cross-sectional area by the thickness to get the volume of each slice:
            <me>
              V_k = A(x_k^*)\Delta x
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Approximate the total volume of the solid by adding the volumes of the slices together:
            <me>
              V \approx \sum_{k=1}^n A(x_k^*)\Delta x
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Apply a limit, where the number of slices gets infinitely big (and the thickness of each slice gets infinitely small):
            <md>
              <mrow>V \amp = \lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=1}^n A(x_k^*)\Delta x</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \int_{x=a}^{x=b} A(x)\;dx</mrow>
            </md>
            Here, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the <m>x</m>-values that define the interval we're slicing along and <m>A(x)</m> is a formula for the cross-sectional area of the object at <m>x</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      The biggest issue here is going to be thinking about that formula for area. In order for us to do that, we're going to think about a specific type of 3-dimensional solid, built in a systematic way so that we can find the cross-sectional areas easily.

    <title>Solids of Revolution</title>
    <p>
      A <term>solid of revolution</term> is a strange type of solid: we're going to define it based on a 2-dimensional region (we'll use functions in a normal <m>xy</m>-plane) that we then imagine revolving around a straight line axis. Maybe we define some region in the upper half of the plane, but then revolve it around the <m>x</m>-axis. While we imagine this revolution, we want to think about the three dimensional solid that gets "traced" by the curve spinning around the axis. Let's dive into an example to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's visualize some function <m>f(x)</m> defined (and continuous) on the interval <m>[a,b]</m> and with <m>f(x)\geq 0</m> on that interval. We'll see why this is useful, but for now, we're just thinking of some function.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-Disks-1">
      <caption></caption>
      <image source="./ApplicationsIntegrals/Disks-1.png" width="70%">
        <shortdescription>A graph of a red curve labeled f(x). The curve is above the x-axis and starts at the y-axis, and moves forward until it stops. There is are two points on the x-axis labeled x=a and x=b, representing the beginning and ending of the interval where this function is defined. The function looks like a sort of curvy polynomial, and the shape is unimportant.</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We're going to revolve this curve (and the region bounded between it and the <m>x</m>-axis) around the <m>x</m>-axis. This will create the following shape.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-Disks-2">
      <caption></caption>
      <image source="./ApplicationsIntegrals/Disks-2.png" width="70%">
        <shortdescription>The red curve, f(x), has been revolved around the x-axis. There is a reflection of this curve below the axis, and lines connecting the ends so that the shape looks like a vase on its side, where the outline of the vase is shaped like the graph f(x).</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      So our goal is to find the volume of this type of solid. The curve defining the edge of it can change, but the way that we create it will be systematic enough that we can build a formulaic integral expression for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you would imagine, we'll start with a rectangle.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-Disks-3">
      <caption></caption>
      <image source="./ApplicationsIntegrals/Disks-3.png" width="70%">
        <shortdescription>A graph of a red curve labeled f(x). The curve is above the x-axis and starts at the y-axis, and moves forward until it stops. There is are two points on the x-axis labeled x=a and x=b, representing the beginning and ending of the interval where this function is defined. The function looks like a sort of curvy polynomial, and the shape is unimportant. There is a red rectangle spanning from the x-axis to the curve, touching the curve at a point labeled (x_k^*, f(x_k^*)). The width of the rectangle is labeled Delta x.</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This rectangle will represent a single, generic slice. We really want to imagine a slice of the 3-dimensional solid, though, and so we will revolve this rectangle around the <m>x</m>-axis. This will create a slice of our solid of revolution. From there, we can think about the volume of this generic <m>k</m>th slice, and fall into the rhythm of our slice-and-sum process.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-Disks-4">
      <caption></caption>
      <image source="./ApplicationsIntegrals/Disks-4.png" width="70%">
        <shortdescription>The red curve, f(x), has been revolved around the x-axis. There is a reflection of this curve below the axis, and lines connecting the ends so that the shape looks like a vase on its side, where the outline of the vase is shaped like the graph f(x). Somewhere in the middle of the vase is a sliced region, looking like a small coin. This is the rectangle, revolved around the axis. The point on the curve is still labeled (x_k^*, f(x_k^*)) and the width of this slice is labeled Delta x.</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We want to find the volume of this specific slice. To do this, we can remove this stubby cylinder from the solid and think about it directly. We can see the thickness of the slice is represented by <m>\Delta x</m>, and so we need to think about the cross-sectional area of the "face" of this slice.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-Disks-6">
      <caption></caption>
      <image source="./ApplicationsIntegrals/Disks-6.png" width="40%">
        <shortdescription>A circle where the radius is labeled r=f(x_k^*).</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This is something we can easily find the area of! We know the formula for the area of a circle: <m>A=\pi r^2</m>. We'll notice that the radius of this circle is the distance from the center of our slice to the outer edge: this is the height of the rectangle in <xref ref="fig-Disks-3"/>. So we can use <m>r=f(x_k^*)</m>, giving us the cross-sectional area of the <m>k</m>th slice:
      <me>
        A(x_k^*) = \pi \left(f(x_k^*)\right)^2
      </me>.
      Now we can drop into our slice and sum process:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The volume of the <m>k</m>th slice is:
            <md>
              <mrow>V_k \amp = A(x_k^*) \Delta x</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \pi\left(f(x_k^*)\right)^2 \Delta x</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We can approximate the volume by adding the slices:
            <me>
              V \approx \sum_{k=1}^n \pi\left(f(x_k^*)\right)^2 \Delta x
            </me>
            Sometimes this can be hard to visualize. We're approximating the solid in <xref ref="fig-Disks-2"/> by thinking about a bunch of these circular disks stacked next to each other.
          </p>
          <figure xml:id="fig-Disks-5">
            <caption></caption>
            <image source="./ApplicationsIntegrals/Disks-5.png" width="70%">
              <shortdescription>The 3-dimensional solid, but there are 10 grey circular disks stacked next to each other. The radius of each varies, matching with the curve outlining the vase-like image.</shortdescription>
            </image>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We can apply a limit to evaluate the actual volume of the solid and construct a definite integral.
            <md>
              <mrow>V \amp = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k=1}^n \pi\left(f(x_k^*)\right)^2 \Delta x</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = \int_{x=a}^{x=b} \pi (f(x))^2\;dx</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is great! We'll call this volume integral the <term>Disk Method</term>, since each cross section is a circular disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens if we add a second curve defining a lower boundary to the region, like we did in <xref ref="sec-AreaBetweenCurves" text="type-global-title"/> for areas?
