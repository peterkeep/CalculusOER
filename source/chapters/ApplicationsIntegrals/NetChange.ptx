  <title>Integrals as Net Change</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have some rudimentary ideas of what an integral is, but we want to challenge and expand those ideas by examining the object at the root of the definition of the <xref ref="def-DefiniteIntegral" text="title"/>: a <xref ref="def-RiemannSum" text="title"/>. We want to generalize a bit more our notion of what a Riemann sum is. So for now, let's think about how we can use a Riemann sum to think about a measurement that will <em>not</em> be an area. That's been our only real context so far, so let's try to stretch that thinking.

      So what are the big ideas in this short activity? There are a lot, and many of them are already things we know, at least to some level.
      So we are really focusing on adding depth to our understanding of these big ideas.
      Let's list them in the order that they showed up in this activity:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          We interpret the velocity as the derivative of the position of the object. So when we interpret the value of the velocity of the object (large vs small, positive vs negative, etc.) we are interpreting these through the lens of a rate of change.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Acceleration is the derivative of the velocity function. While we don't have the full picture of the velocity function at any value of <m>t</m>, we still were interested in the rates at which velocity changes with regard to time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We can estimate the total <em>displacement</em> of the object by predicting how far it traveled in eahc 30-second time interval. We might pick the starting velocity for each 30-second interval and multiply that by 30 seconds. We could alternatively pick the ending velocity of each 30-second interval. Then we can add all of these products of velocity and time together to approximate a total change in position! Doesn't this feel like a Riemann sum?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When we calculate displacement, the negative velocities get multiplied out to get negative changes in position for the object -- that's because a negative velocity means that the object is moving backwards. If we wanted to calculate the distance traveled, then we need to not account for negative velocities. We can just disregard the sign of the velocity on each time interval and repeat the process above. So, another Riemann sum then?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In order to forecast some position at time <m>t</m>, we just need to start with the initial position, and then calculate (or approximate) the displacement from <m>t=0</m> to whatever time <m>t\leq 300</m> we care about, and then add the displacement to the intitial position.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Ok, now let's formalize those results!
  </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-position-velocity-acceleration">
    <title>Position, Velocity, and Acceleration</title>
    <p>
      We know that the velocity of an object is really a rate of change of the position of that object with regard to time. 
Similarly, the acceleration of an object is the rate of change of the velocity of the object with regard to time.
So we're really thinking about derivatives!
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-position-velocity-acceleration">
      <title>Position, Velocity, and Acceleration Functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For an object moving along a straight line, if <m>s(t)</m> represents the <term>position</term> of that object at time <m>t</m>, then the <term>velocity</term> of the object at time <m>t</m> is <m>v(t) = s'(t)</m> and the <term>acceleration</term> of the object at time <m>t</m> is <m>a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Once we establish this relationship, we can answer questions about movement of an object using the same interpretations of derivatives that we practiced in Chapter 3 of this text.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-displacement-distance-speed">
    <title>Displacement, Distance, and Speed</title>
    <p>
      Let's revisit <xref ref="act-EstimatingMovement"/>. When we approximated the displacement of the object, we built a Riemann sum:

      <me>\sum_{k=1}^{10} v(t_k^*) \Delta t</me>

      We chose our <m>t_k^*</m> as either the time at the beginning of each 30-second interval or the time atr the end of the 30-second interval, but that was only because of the limited information that we had about different values of <m>v(t)</m>. If we had information about the <m>v(t)</m> function at any values of <m>t</m> (<m>0\leq t\leq 300</m>), then we could pick <em>any</em> time in each 30-second time interval for our Riemann sum!

      We might note, though, that if we did have this kind of information about the velocity at any time in the 5-minute interval, then we would also build a more precise approximation by subdividing the time interval into smaller/shorter pieces.

      So maybe the Riemann sum <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{100} v(t_k^*)\Delta t</m> (where we are dividing up the 5 minute interval into 100 3-second intervals) would do a better job!

      But why stop there? If we have the definition of the velocity function, and so we can truly obtain the velocity of the object at <em>any</em> time in the 5 minute interval, then we can use the definition of the definite integral as the limit of a Riemann sum:

      <me>\lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k=1}^n v(t_k^*) \Delta t = \int_{t=0}^{t=300} v(t)\;dt</me>

      This should work out well with our first understanding of displacement: the displacement of an object is just the difference in position from the starting time to the ending time. So we could say that if <m>s(t)</m> is the position function, then we might expect to represent displacement from <m>t=a</m> to <m>t=b</m> as <m>s(b)-s(a)</m>. But isn't this just the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since <m>s'(t) = v(t)</m>?
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-displacement">
      <title>Displacement of an Object</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If an object is moving along a straight line with velocity <m>v(t)</m> and position <m>s(t)</m>, then the <term>displacement</term> of the object from time <m>t=a</m> to <m>t=b</m> is 
          <me>\int_{t=a}^{t=b} v(t)\;dt = s(b)-s(a)</me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Let's keep revisiting the same activity. We also noticed that when we looked at the <em>distance</em> compared to the displacement, the only difference was that we were integrating the absolute value of the velocity function, since we didn't care about the sign of the velocity (the direction that the object was traveling) on each interval.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-distance">
      <title>Distance Traveled</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If an object is moving along a straight line with velocity <m>v(t)</m>, then the <term>distance</term> traveled by the object from time <m>t=a</m> to <m>t=b</m> is:
          <me>\int_{t=a}^{t=b}|v(t)|\;dt</me>
          Here, we call <m>|v(t)|</m> the <term>speed</term> of the object (instead of the velocity).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We should note that we don't have any quick and easy ways of dealing with the integral of the absolute value of a function.

      <me>
        |v(t)| = 
        \begin{cases}
            -v(t) \amp \text{when } v(t)\lt 0\\
            \phantom{-}v(t) \amp \text{when } v(t)\geq 0
        \end{cases}
      </me>

      So, in order for us to integrate <m>|v(t)|</m>, we need to think about where the velocity passes through 0, so that we can see where it might change from positive to negative.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-FutureValueFunction">
    <title>Finding the Future Value of a Function</title>
    <p>
      We can again think back to <xref ref="act-EstimatingMovement"/> and build our last result of this section. Remember when we were looking to predict the location of our object at different times: we said it was reasonable to start at our initial position, and then add the displacement of the object from that initial time up to the time that we were interested in. So, to estimate the object's position after 150 seconds, we would calculate:
      <me>
        s(0)+\int_{t=0}^{t=150} v(t)\;dt
      </me>.
      But we said we could do this to estimate the object's position at any value for time, <m>t</m>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-FuturePosition">
      <title>Future Position of an Object</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For some object moving along a straight line with velocity <m>v(t)</m> and an initial position of <m>s(a)</m>, the <term>future position of the object</term> at some time <m>t</m> (with <m>t\geq a</m>) is:
          <me>
            \underbrace{s(t)}_{\text{future}\atop \text{position}} = \underbrace{s(a)}_{\text{initial}\atop\text{position}} + \underbrace{\int_{x=a}^{x=t} v(x)\;dx}_{\text{displacement from}\atop{a \text{ to } t}}
          </me>
        
        Note that we change the variable in the velocity function while we integrate: since we want our position function to be in terms of <m>t</m>, the ending time point that we calculate the displacement up to, we need to choose a different variable to write velocity in terms of. Mechanically, there is no difference, since we're just swapping out the variables and naming them <m>x</m>.</p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We can note that this relationship between velocity and position can exist in many other context: any pair of functions that are derivatives/antiderivatives of each other can have this relationship!
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-FutureValue">
      <title>Net Change and Future Value</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose the value <m>F(t)</m> changes over time at a known rate <m>F'(t)</m>. Then the <term>net change</term> in <m>F</m> between <m>t=a</m> and <m>t=b</m> is:
          <me>
            F(b)-F(a) = \int_{t=a}^{t=b} F'(t)\;dt
          </me>.
          Similarly, given the initial value <m>F(a)</m>, the <term>future value</term> of <m>F</m> at time <m>t\geq a</m> is:
          <me>
            F(t) = F(a) + \int_{x=a}^{x=t} F'(x)\;dx
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
