                When we set up an optimization problem, we normally look for some formula connecting information that we have with the thing we want to optimize, some sort of constraint or link between variables, and an clue to whether we want to find a maximum or minimum. From this, we work to create a <q>Calculus Statement</q> which includes a function (of one variable) that we want to find the absolute maximum or minimum of on a domain.

                Consider a box created from an 18in square piece of material. We form the box by cutting an <m>h</m>-inch square out of each corner, and folding the sides up along the dotted lines.

                A trucking service is looking to add a route to their plan, but the road that they are considering passes through a tunnel. The top of the opening above the driving lane is formed by the curve <m>y=4-\dfrac{4}{27}x^3</m>. The width from the center line to the edge of the tunnel is 3 meters. What are the dimensions for the largest rectangular trailer the trucking service could pull through the tunnel?

                A circular area of radius 20ft. is surrounded by a paved pathway. A lamp post is placed in the middle of the circular area. What height should the light be to illuminate the walk most strongly? The intensity of illumination is <m>I=\dfrac{\sin\theta}{s}</m> where <m>s</m> is the distance form the light source and <m>\theta</m> is the angle at which the light hits the surface.
