    <title>Building L'HÃ´pital's Rule</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to take a closer look at the indeterminate form, <m>\frac{0}{0}</m>, and use our new ideas of linear approximation to think about how these types of things work.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're going to be working with the following limit:
            <me>\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</me>
            where <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are differentiable at <m>x=a</m> (since we're going to want to build linear approximations of them).
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Write out the linear approximations for both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>, both centered at <m>x=a</m>. We'll call them <m>L_f(x)</m> and <m>L_g(x)</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                We're just using the formula for <xref ref="def-LinearApproximation" text="title"/>, but with <m>f(x)</m> for one of them and <m>g(x)</m> in the other.
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Describe how well or how poorly these linear approximations estimate the values from our functions <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>? What happens to these approximations as we get close to the center <m>x=a</m>? What happens in the limit as <m>x\to a</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You can revisit the local linearity visualization from <xref ref="sec-LinearApproximation"/> to see what happens, in general, with a linear approximation of a function as we zoom in on the center.
            </p>
        </hint>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let's re-write our limit. We can replace <m>f(x)</m> with our formula for its linear approximation, <m>L_f(x)</m> and replace <m>g(x)</m> with its linear approximation, <m>L_g(x)</m>:
                <me>
                    \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a} \left(\frac{<fillin characters="15" />}{<fillin characters="15" />}\right)
                </me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Up until now, we have not thought about indeterminate forms at all. Let's start now.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this limit is a <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> indeterminate form, then that means that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = 0</m> and <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} g(x) = 0</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since our functions are, by definition, differentiable at <m>x=a</m>, then they also have to be continuous at <m>x=a</m>. What does this mean about the values of <m>f(a)</m> and <m>g(a)</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Take a look back at our definition of function being <xref ref="def-ContinuousAtPoint" text="title"/>. How does the function value relate to the limit? What does that mean in our case?
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Use this new information about the values of <m>f(a)</m> and <m>g(a)</m> to revisit the limit. We re-wrote <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}</m> by replacing each function with its linear approximation. What happens with the algebra when we know this information about <m>f(a)</m> and <m>g(a)</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                We re-wrote
                <me>
                    \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a} \left(\frac{f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)}{g'(a)(x-a)+g(a)}\right)
                </me>
                and also know that in this case (due to the <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> indeterminate form) that <m>f(a)=0</m> and <m>g(a)=0</m>.
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <conclusion>
        <p>
            So we have a really nice result here! In the <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> indeterminate form, we can replace the ratio of the <m>y</m>-values from our functions with the ratio of slopes (coming from the first derivatives) of our functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, we'll put a step in between, where we find <m>f'(x)</m> and <m>g'(x)</m> first before trying to evaluate these derivatives at <m>x=a</m>.
        </p>
    </conclusion>
