            <p>
                Consider the two curves pictured below. Compare and contrast them. What characteristics of these functions are the same? What characteristics of these functions are different?

                Explain the similarities you found by only talking about the slopes of each function (the values of <m>f'(x)</m> and <m>g'(x)</m>).

                Make a conjecture about the <em>rate of change</em> of both <m>f'</m> and <m>g'</m>. We'll call these things <term>second derivative</term> functions, <m>f''(x)</m> and <m>g''(x)</m>.
