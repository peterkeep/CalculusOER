    <title>First Derivative Test Graphically</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's focus on looking at a picture of a derivative, <m>f'(x)</m>, and trying to collect information about the function <m>f(x)</m>. This is what we've done already, except that we've done it by thinking about the representation of <m>f'(x)</m> as a function rule written out with algebraic symbols. Here we'll focus on connecting all of that to the picture of the graphs.
        </p>
        <p>
            For all of the following questions, refer to the plot below. You can add information with the hints whenever you need to. Don't reveal the picture of <m>f(x)</m> until you're really ready to check what you know.

                Based on the graph of <m>f'(x)</m>, estimate the interval(s) of <m>x</m>-values where <m>f(x)</m> is increasing.

                Find the <m>x</m>-values of the critical points of <m>f(x)</m>. Once you've estimated these, classify them as local maximums, local minimums, or neither. Explain your reasoning.

                What do you think the graph of <m>f(x)</m> looks like? Do your best to sketch it or explain it before revealing it!

                Why could we estimate the <m>x</m>-values of the critical numbers of <m>f(x)</m>, but not find the actual coordinates? How come we can't find the <m>y</m>-value based on looking at the graph of <m>f'(x)</m>?
