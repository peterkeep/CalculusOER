    <title>Comparing Critical Points</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's think about four different functions:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>f(x) = 4+3x-x^2</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>g(x) = \sqrt[3]{x+1}+1+x</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>h(x)=(x-4)^{2/3}</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>j(x)=1-x^3-x^5</m>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            Our goal is to find the critical points on the interval <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> and then to try to figure out if these critical points are local maximums or local minimums or just points that the function increases or decreases through.
        </p>

                To start, we're going to be finding critical points. Without looking at a picture of the graph of the function, find the derivative.
            </p>
            <p>
                Are there any <m>x</m>-values (in the domain of the function) where the derivative doesn't exist? We are normally looking for things like division by 0 here, but we could be finding more than that. Check out <xref ref="strat-DerivativesDontExist" text="title"/> to remind yourself if needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Are there any <m>x</m>-values (in the domain of the function) where the derivative is 0?

        <statement>
            <p>
                Now that we have the critical points for the function, let's think about where the derivative might be positive and negative. These will correspond to the direction of a function, based on <xref ref="thm-IncreasingDecreasing" text="type-global-title"/>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Write out the intervals of <m>x</m>-values around and between your list of critical points. For each interval, what is the sign of the derivative? What do these signs mean about the direction of your function?

                Without looking at the graph of your function:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            What changes about how your function increases up to or decreases down to a critical point based on whether the derivative was 0 or the derivative didn't exist?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Does your function change direction at a critical point? What will that look like, whether it does or does not change direction?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </statement>

        <statement>
            <p>
                Give a basic sketch of your graph. It might be helpful to find the <m>y</m>-values for any critical points you've got. Then you can sketch your function increasing/decreasing in the intervals between these points.
            </p>
            <p>
                In your sketch, include enough detail to tell whether the derivative is 0 or doesn't exist at each critical point.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Compare your sketch to the actual graph of the function (you can find all of the graphs in the hint).
