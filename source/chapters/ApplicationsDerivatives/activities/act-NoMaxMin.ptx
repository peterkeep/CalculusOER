    <title>When Would We Not Have Maximums or Minimnums?</title> 
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section, we're going to define these global maximums and then, most importantly, try to predict when these global maximums or global minimums might actually exist for a function.
        </p>
        <p>
            To start, maybe we should come up with some examples of functions that do not have them!

            <p>
                Come up with some situations where a function does not have some combination of global maximum/minimums. Sketch some graphs!

            <p>
                Come up with some examples of graphs of functions that are bounded (do not ever have <m>y</m>-values that tend towards infinity in a limit) that do not have some combination of global maximum/minimums.

                For the examples of graphs that you have built or collected, features of the functions that allow for the examples you picked? If you could impose some requirements that would "fix" the examples you found (so that they had both a global maximum and a global minimum), what requirements could you use?
