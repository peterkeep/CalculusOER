    <title>Approximating an Exponential Function</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's consider the function <m>f(x)=e^x</m>. We're going to build the linear approximation, <m>L(x)</m>, but we also want to focus on understanding what the <q>center</q> is, and how we think about accuracy of our estimations.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                We first need to find a <q>good</q> center for our linear approximation. We have two real requirements here:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We need the center to be some <m>x</m>-value that will be <q>close</q> to the inputs we're most interested in. We know that <m>L(x)\approx f(x)</m> for <m>x</m>-values <q>near</q> the center, so we should keep this in mind. We don't have a specific input that we're interested in (we are not specifically focused on estimating <m>f(7.35)</m> for instance), so we don't need to worry about this for now.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We are going to need to evaluate the function and its derivative at the center: we use <m>f'(a)</m> to find the slope and <m>f(a)</m> to find a <m>y</m>-value for a point on the line. We'd like to choose a center that will make evaluating these functions reasonable, if we can!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                We are going to choose a center of 0: why?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Build a linear approximation of <m>f(x)=e^x</m> centered at <m>x=0</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Build a line with a slope of <m>f'(0)</m> that goes through the point <m>(0, f(0))</m>.
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Use your linear approximation to estimate the value of <m>\sqrt[10]{e} = e^{\frac{1}{10}}</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Since <m>L(x)\approx f(x)</m> for <m>x</m>-values near 0, we can say that <m>L(1/10)\approx f(1/10)</m>. So you can evaluate your linear approximation function at <m>x=\frac{1}{10}</m>.
            </p>
        </hint>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let's visualize this approximation a bit:
            </p>

                    <slate surface="doenetml">
                        <xi:include parse="text" href="../doenet/LinearApproximation-Exponential.xml"/>
                    </slate>
                </interactive>
            <p>
                Are you confident in your approximation of <m>\sqrt[10]{e}</m>? Would you be more or less confident in an approximation of <m>\frac{1}{e}</m>? Why?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Is your estimate of <m>\sqrt[10]{e}</m> too big or too small? How can you tell, without even calculating the actual value of <m>\sqrt[10]{e}</m>?
            </p>
            <p>
                How can you tell that <em>every</em> estimate that you get out of <em>any</em> linear approximation of <m>e^x</m> (no matter what the center is) is going to be too small?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                It might be helpful to think about how the function moves away from the tangent line: how do the slopes of <m>e^x</m> change? Can you link this to ideas of concavity?
            </p>
