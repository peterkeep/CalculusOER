      <title>Where is a Function not Continuous?</title>
      <p>
        Most of the functions that we consider in this text will be continuous everywhere that it makes sense: on their domain. That is, if there is a point defined at some <m>x</m>-value, it is likely that the function's limit matches the <m>y</m>-value of the point. More specifically, though:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              A function is discontinuous at any location that results in an infinite limit. These are locations where <m>f(x)</m> is undefined and the limit is infinite (and so doesn't exist).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A function is, in general, discontinuous wherever it is undefined. This seems silly to say! We probably could have left this unsaid. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A function that is defined as a piecewise function could be discontinuous at locations where the pieces meet: maybe the limit doesn't exist, or maybe the function value is not defined, or maybe the limit exists and the function value is defined but they do not match.

      <title>Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>f(x)</m> is a function that is continuous on <m>[a,b]</m> with <m>f(a)\neq f(b)</m> and <m>L</m> is any real number between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m> (either <m>f(a)\lt L \lt f(b)</m> or <m>f(b) \lt L \lt f(a)</m>), then there exists some <m>c</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> (<m>a\lt c \lt b</m>) such that <m>f(c)=L</m>.

        This theorem was stated as early as the 5th century BCE by Bryson of Heraclea. Back then, a really interesting problem was related to "squaring the circle." That is, given a circle with some measurable radius, can we construct a square with equal area? This is obviously true, in that we can just use a square with the side length <m>r\sqrt{\pi}</m>. What we typically mean by "construct," though, is to create this square using only a compass and straightedge (a ruler without length markings) and only a finite number of steps. This was finally proven to be impossible in 1882, approximately 2300 years later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bryson of Heraclea knew that the square itself existed (even if he couldn't construct it) because he was able to find a square with area less than a circle (by inscribing a square inside of the circle) and a square with area greater than a circle (where the circle is inscribed in the square). Since he posited that he could increase the size of the square in a continuous manner (without using those words), he claimed that a square with area equal to that of the circle must exist, since the area of the square passes through all values from the smaller area to the larger area.
