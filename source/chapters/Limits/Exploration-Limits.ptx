    <title>Exploration: Limits</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to return to the definition of the <xref ref="def-Limit" text="title"/>, and try to add some more precision to the way that we talk about these limits. We'll recreate the definition, without some of the ambiguous terminology, and then explore the new definition a bit, in order to get a good feel for what this means. 
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of this exploration, we should have a pretty good understanding of what a limit is, it should match our intuition that we've built, and we should see a path that we <em>could</em> walk to investigate how these limit properties and results that we've talked about could be described.

        <title>Precise Definition of Limits</title>
        <p>
            What are the areas in the definition of a limit where we need to add precision?

            <title>A First Function to Think About</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    Let's consider the function <m>f(x)=\sqrt{x}</m>. We're going to mostly be interested in the <m>x</m>-values around 9, since we'll be investigating <m>\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 9}\sqrt{x}</m>. We know that the <m>y</m>-value outputs of <m>f(x)</m> are going to be around 3, giving us:
                    <me>
                        \lim_{x\to 9} \sqrt{x}=3
                    </me>.
                    Now we're going to perform some tasks that will hopefully help us add some precision to our definition of a limit. You can use the graph and inputs below while you work.

Construct a new target interval of <m>y</m>-values, and see if you can find an interval of <m>x</m>-values such that all of the function outputs are in your target interval.

            Our goal, now, is to summarize what we've done.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We built a system to talk about <m>y</m>-values that are <q>arbitrarily close the single, real number, <m>L</m>.</q> We constructed an interval, <m>(L-\varepsilon, L+\varepsilon)</m> for any <m>\varepsilon\gt 0</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also thought about this in terms of distance, by considering the <m>y</m>-values that were within <m>\varepsilon</m> units of <m>y=L</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We found a way to talk about <m>x</m>-values being <q>sufficiently close to, but not equal to, <m>a</m>.</q> We constructed an interval of <m>x</m>-values <em>around</em> <m>x=a</m>, and then considered the function outputs from those <m>x</m>-values. We should clarify that we really are considering the function outputs from all of these <m>x</m>-values in the interval <em>except</em> <m>x=a</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also talked about this in terms of distance! We want to construct <m>x</m>-values that are some non-zero distance away from <m>x=a</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We tried to come up with a way of describing this interval of <m>x</m>-values<mdash/>whose function outputs (except <m>f(a)</m>) are all guaranteed to be in <m>(L-\varepsilon, L+\varepsilon)</m><mdash/>using a kind of function of <m>\varepsilon</m>. That way, we can know that we can repeat this process for <em>any</em> <m>\varepsilon</m> measure of <q>closeness.</q>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we refer to that function of <m>\varepsilon</m> to give us the distance for the <m>x</m>-values, we often use the symbol, <m>\delta</m>. Sometimes people call this <m>\delta_{\varepsilon}</m> as a way of reminding ourselves that it depends on the value of <m>\varepsilon</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This gives us two definitions that we can think of as a way of adding precision to the idea of a limit.

                    if, for any open interval <m>(p,q)</m> of <m>y</m>-values containing the single, real number <m>L</m>, there is some corresponding open interval <m>(c, d)</m> around <m>x=a</m> (that is, <m>c\lt a\lt d</m>) such that for all <m>x</m>-values in <m>(c,d)</m> with <m>x\neq a</m>, the function output <m>f(x)</m> is in <m>(p,q)</m>.

            Both of these definitions are very important to the further study of calculus, but especially important it to use these definitions of limits to think about continuity.

            We can say that a function is continuous at some point if every open interval in the range of the function around the <m>y</m>-value of the point comes from an open interval in the domain of the function around the <m>x</m>-value of the point. This is a very useful and important definition for the study of <term>topology</term>, and a nice way of generalizing the concept of continuity.
