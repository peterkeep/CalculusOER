    <title>The Squeeze Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For some functions <m>f(x)</m>, <m>g(x)</m>, and <m>h(x)</m> which are all defined and ordered <m>f(x)\leq g(x)\leq h(x)</m> for <m>x</m>-values near <m>x=a</m> (but not necessarily at <m>x=a</m> itself), and for some real number <m>L</m>, if we know that 
        <me>
          \lim_{x\to a} f(x) = L = \lim_{x\to a} h(x)
        </me>
        then we also know that <m>\lim_{x\to a} g(x) = L</m>.
