    <title>A Weird End Behavior Limit</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this activity, we're going to find the following limit:
            <me>
                \lim_{x\to\infty} \left(\dfrac{\sin^2(x)}{x^2+1}\right)
            </me>.
            This limit is a bit weird, in that we really haven't looked at trigonometric functions that much. We're going to start by looking at a different limit in the hopes that we can eventually build towards this one.

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider, instead, the following limit:
                <me>
                    \lim_{x\to\infty} \left(\frac{1}{x^2+1}\right)
                </me>.
                Find the limit and connect the process or intuition behind it to at least one of the results from this text.

                Start with <xref ref="thm-CombinationsOfLimits"/> to think about the numerator and denominator separately.

                Can you use <xref ref="thm-PolynomialEndBehavior"/> in the denominator?

                Let's put this limit aside and briefly talk about the sine function. What are some things to remember about this function? What should we know? How does it behave?

                What kinds of values doe we expect <m>\sin(x)</m> to take on for different values of <m>x</m>?
                <me><fillin characters="10" /> \leq \sin(x) \leq <fillin characters="10" /></me>

                What happens when we square the sine function? What kinds of  values can that take on?
                <me><fillin characters="10" /> \leq \sin^2(x) \leq <fillin characters="10" /></me>

                Think back to our original goal: we wanted to know the end behavior of <m>\dfrac{\sin^2(x)}{x^2+1}</m>. Right now we have two bits of information:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We know <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to\infty}\left(\frac{1}{x^2+1}\right)</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We know some information about the behavior of <m>\sin^2(x)</m>. Specifically, we have some bounds on its values.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Can we combine this information?
            </p>
            <p>
                In your inequality above, multiply <m>\left(\frac{1}{x^2+1}\right)</m> onto all three pieces of the inequality. Make sure you're convinced about the direction or order of the inequality and whether or not it changes with this multiplication.
                <me>\underbrace{\frac{<fillin characters="10" />}{x^2+1}}_{\text{call this }f(x)} \leq \frac{\sin^2(x)}{x^2+1} \leq \underbrace{\frac{<fillin characters="10" />}{x^2+1}}_{\text{call this }h(x)} </me>

            <p>
                For your functions <m>f(x)</m> and <m>h(x)</m>, evaluate <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)</m> and <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to\infty} h(x)</m>.

                What do you think this means about the limit we're interested in, <m>\displaystyle \lim_{x\to\infty} \left(\frac{\sin^2(x)}{x^2+1}\right)</m>?
