    <title>What Happens When We Divide by 0?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            First, let's make sure we're clear on one thing: there is no real number than is represented as some other number divided by 0.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we talk about "dividing by 0" here (and in <xref ref="sec-IndeterminateForms"/>), we're talking about the behavior of some function in a limit. We want to consider what it might look like to have a function that involves division where the denominator <em>gets arbitrarily close to 0</em> (or, the limit of the denominator is 0).

                Remember when, once upon a time, you learned that dividing one a number by a  fraction is the same as multiplying the first number by the reciprocal of the fraction? Why is this true?

                What is the relationship between a number and its reciprocal? How does the size of a number impact the size of the reciprocal? Why?

                Consider <m>12\div N</m>. What is the value of this division problem when:
