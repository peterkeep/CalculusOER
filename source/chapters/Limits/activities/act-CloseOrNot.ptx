    <title>Close or Not?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to try to think how we might define <q>close</q>-ness as a property, but, more importantly, we're going to try to realize the struggle of creating definitions in a mathematical context. We want our definition to be meaningful, precise, and useful, and those are hard goals to reach! Coming to some agreement on this is a particularly tricky task.

                For each of the following pairs of things, decide on which pairs you would classify as <q>close</q> to each other.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            You, right now, and the nearest city with a population of 1 million or higher
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Your two nostrils
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            You and the door of the room you are in
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            You and the person nearest you
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The floor of the room you are in and the ceiling of the room you are in
                        </p>

            <p>
                For your classification of <q>close,</q> what does <q>close</q> mean? Finish the sentence: A pair of objects are <em>close</em> to each other if...
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's think about how close two things would have to be in order to satisfy everyone's definition of <q>close.</q> Pick two objects that you think everyone would agree are <q>close,</q> if by <q>everyone</q> we meant:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            All of the people in the building you are in right now.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            All of the people in the city that you are in right now.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            All of the people in the country that you are in right now.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Everyone, everywhere, all at once.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Let's put ourselves into the context of functions and numbers. Consider the linear function <m>y=4x-1</m>. Our goal is to find some <m>x</m>-values that, when we put them into our function, give us <m>y</m>-value outputs that are <q>close</q> to the number 2. You get to define what close means.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, evaluate <m>f(0)</m> and <m>f(1)</m>. Are these <m>y</m>-values <q>close</q> to 2, in your definition of <q>close?</q>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Pick five more, different, numbers that are <q>close</q> to 2 in your definition of <q>close.</q> For each one, find the <m>x</m>-values that give you those <m>y</m>-values.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                How far away from <m>x=\frac{3}{4}</m> can you go and still have <m>y</m>-value outputs that are <q>close</q> to 2?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <conclusion>
        <p>
            To wrap this up, think about your points that you have: you have a list of <m>x</m>-coordinates that are clustered around <m>x=\frac{3}{4}</m> where, when you evaluate <m>y=4x-1</m> at those <m>x</m>-values, you get <m>y</m>-values that are <q>close</q> to 2. Great!
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you think others will agree? Or do you think that other people might look at your list of <m>y</m>-values and decide that some of them <em>aren't</em> close to 2?
        </p>
        <p>
            Do you think you would agree with other peoples' lists? Or you do think that you might look at other peoples' lists of <m>y</m>-values and decide that some of them <em>aren't</em> close to 2?
        </p>
