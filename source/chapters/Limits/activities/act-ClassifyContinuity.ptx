            Let's consider the following functions, graphed below.

            <p>
                Can you point out any points on the functions above that seem like the functions might not be continuous? Note that we're not classifying each function as <q>continuous</q> or <q>not continuous</q>!

        <statement>
            <p>
                We want to build towards a definition of continuity using <q>connectedness</q> as the key: a function is continuous at a point if it is connected to itself. How does that work when we think about function values and limits? Use the graphs above and the points you looked at to help!
