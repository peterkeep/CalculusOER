            We're going to look at four graphs of functions, as well as a list of limit statements. Match the limit statements with the graphs that match that behavior. Note that is is possible for a limit to be relevant on more than one graph.

                Now consider these four function definitions. Using your knowledge of limits, as well as the matching you've already done, match the definitions of these four functions with the graphs that go with them, and then also the limits that are relevant. (These limits will already be matched with the graphs, so you don't need to do further work here).
