    <title>What Happens When We Divide by Infinity?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Again, we need to start by making something clear: if we were really going to try divide some real number by infinity, then we would need to re-build our definition of what it means to divide. In the context we're in right now, we only have division defined as an operation for real (and maybe complex) numbers. Since infinity is neither, then we will not literally divide by infinity.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we talk about <q>dividing by infinity</q> here, we're again talking about the behavior of some function in a limit. We want to consider what it might look like to have a function that involves division where the denominator <em>gets arbitrarily large (positive or negative)</em> (or, the limit of the denominator is infinite).

                Consider a function <m>f(x) = \frac{12}{x}</m>. What happens to the value of this function when <m>x\to \infty</m>? Note that this means that the <m>x</m>-values we're considering most are very large and positive.

                Why is there no difference in the behavior of <m>f(x)</m> as <m>x\to \infty</m> compared to <m>x\to -\infty</m> when the sign of the function outputs are opposite (<m>f(x)\gt 0</m> when <m>x\to \infty</m> and <m>f(x) \lt 0</m> when <m>x\to-\infty</m>)?
