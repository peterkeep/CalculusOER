    <title>Building the Derivative of the Logarithm</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to accomplish two things here:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        By the end of this activity, we'll have a nice way of thinking about <m>\ddx{\ln(x)}</m>, and we will now be able to differentiate functions involving logarithms!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Throughout this activity, we're going to develop a way of approaching derivatives of inverse functions more generally. Then we can apply this framework to other functions!
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Let's think about this logarithmic function!
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                We have stated (a couple of times now) how we define the log function:
                <me>
                    y=e^x \longleftrightarrow x=\ln(y)
                </me>.
                This arrow goes both directions: the log function is the inverse of the exponential, but the exponential is the inverse of the log function!                
            </p>
            <p>
                Can you rewrite the relationship <m>y=\ln(x)</m> using its inverse (the exponential)?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                For your inverted <m>y=\ln(x)</m> from above (it should be <m>x=<fillin characters="5" /></m>), apply a derivative operator to both sides, and use implicit differentiation to find <m>\dydx</m> or <m>y'</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Where do we have to use the Chain Rule?
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A weird thing that we can notice is that when we use implicit differentiation, it is common to end up with our derivative written in terms of both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> variables. This makes sense for our earlier examples: we needed specific coordinates of the point on the circle, for instance, to find the slope there.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if <m>y=\ln(x)</m>, we want <m>\dydx</m> or <m>y'</m> to be a function of <m>x</m>: 
                <me>
                    f(x)=\ln(x) \longrightarrow f'(x)=<fillin characters="5" />
                </me>.
                Your derivative is written with only <m>y</m> values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since <m>y=\ln(x)</m>, replace any instance of <m>y</m> with the log function. What do you have left?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Remember that <m>y=\ln(x)</m>. Substitute this into your equation for <m>\dydx</m>. Can you write this in a pretty simplistic way?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Remember that <m>e^{\ln(x)}=x</m>, since these functions are inverses of each other!
            </p>
        </hint>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Before we go much further, we should be a bit careful. What is the domain of this derivative?
            </p>
            <p>
                What are the values of <m>x</m> where <m>\ddx{\ln(x)}</m> makes sense to think about?
            </p>
