    <title>Logarithmic Differentiation with Products and Quotients</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's say we've got some function that has products and quotients in it. Like, a lot. Consider the function:
            <me>
                y=\frac{(x-4)^2\sqrt{3x+1}}{(x+1)^7(x+5)^3}
            </me>.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Work out a general strategy for how you would find <m>y'</m> directly. Where would you have to use Quotient Rule? What are the pieces? Where would you have to use Product Rule? What are the pieces? Where would you have to use Chain Rule? What are the pieces?
            </p>
            <p>
                To be clear: do not actually differentiate this. Just look at it in horror and try to outline a plan that some other fool would use.

                    <mrow> \amp = \dfrac{ (x+1)^7(x+5)^3\ddx{\overbrace{(x-4)^2\sqrt{3x+1}}^{\text{Product Rule}}} - (x-4)^2\sqrt{3x+1} \ddx{\overbrace{(x+1)^7(x+5)^3}^{\text{Product Rule}}}}{((x+1)^7(x+5)^3)^2}</mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \frac{(x+1)^7(x+5)^3\left(2(x-4)\sqrt{3x+1} + \frac{3(x-4)^2}{2\sqrt{3x+1}}\right) - (x-4)^2\sqrt{3x+1}\left(7(x+1)^6(x+5)^3 + 3(x+1)^7(x+5)^2\right)}{(x+1)^{14}(x+5)^{6}}</mrow>

                What now? Can we "simplify" this somehow? Maybe, but I am <em>not</em> doing any more of this!

                Let's instead use logarithmic differentiation. First, apply the log to both sides to get:
                <me>
                    \ln(y) = \ln\left(\frac{(x-4)^2\sqrt{3x+1}}{(x+1)^7(x+5)^3}\right)
                </me>.
                Since this function is just a bunch of products of things with exponents all put into some big quotient, we can use our log properties to re-write this!
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                We should have:
                <me>
                    \ln(y) = 3\ln(x-4)+\frac{1}{2}\ln(3x+1) - 7\ln(x+1) - 3\ln(x+5)
                 </me>.
                Confirm this.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Now differentiate both sides! You'll have to use some Chain Rule (but not a lot)! Refer back to <xref ref="fact-ChainRuleLog"/> for help here.

                Solve for <m>\dydx</m> or <m>y'</m>.

                While this is not a <em>nice</em> looking expression for the derivative, spend some time confirming that this was a nicer <em>process</em> then differentiating directly. This is because logs are friends.
