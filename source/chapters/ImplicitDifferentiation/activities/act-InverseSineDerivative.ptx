    <title>Finding the Derivative of the Inverse Sine Function</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to do the same trick, except that there will be a couple of small differences due to thinking specifically about trigonometric functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's think about the function <m>y=\sin^{-1}(x)</m>. We know that this is equivalent to <m>x=\sin(y)</m> (for <m>y</m>-values in <m>\left[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right]</m>).

                Move the point around the portion of the unit circle in the graph below. Convince yourself that:

                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>\sin(y)=x</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>\sin(y)\geq 0</m> when <m>0\leq y \leq \frac{\pi}{2}</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            <m>\sin(y)\lt 0</m> when <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq y \lt 0</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                What is <m>\cos(y)</m> in this figure? Does the sign change depending on the value of <m>y</m>?

                Use implicit differentiation and the equation <m>x=\sin(y)</m> to find <m>\dydx</m> or <m>y'</m>

                If you still have your derivative written in terms of <m>y</m>, make sure to write <m>\cos(y)</m> in terms of <m>x</m>!

                Let's think about the domain of this derivative: what <m>x</m>-values make sense to think about?
            </p>
            <p>
                Think about this both in terms of what <m>x</m>-values reasonably fit into your formula of <m>\ddx{\sin^{-1}(x)}</m> as well as the domain of the inverse sine function in general.
            </p>

        <statement>
            <p>
                Notice that in the denominator of <m>\ddx{\sin^{-1}(x)}</m>, you have a square root. Based on that information (and the visual above), what do you expect to be true about the sign of the derivative of the inverse sine function?
            </p>
            <p>
                Confirm this by playing with the graph of <m>y=\sin^{-1}(x)</m> below.

                Investigate the behavior of <m>\dydx</m> at the end-points of the function: at <m>x=-1</m> and <m>x=1</m>. What do the slopes look like they're doing, graphically?
            </p>
            <p>
                How does this work when you look at the function you built above? What happens when you try to find <m>\Dydx\bigg|_{x=-1}</m> or <m>\Dydx\bigg|_{x=1}</m>?
