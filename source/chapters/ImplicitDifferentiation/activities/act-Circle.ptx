    <title>Slopes on a Circle</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Visualize the unit circle. Feel free to draw one, or find the picture above. We're going to think about slopes on this circle.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Point out the locations on the unit circle where you would expect to see tangent lines that are perfectly horizontal. What do you think the value of the derivative, <m>\dydx</m>, would be at these points?

                Point out the locations on the unit circle where you would expect to see tangent lines that are perfectly vertical. What do you think the value of the derivative, <m>\dydx</m>, would be at these points?

        <statement>
            <p>
                Find the point(s) where <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m>. What do you think the value of the derivative, <m>\dydx</m>, would be at these points?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                There are two points to consider here: <m>\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)</m> and <m>\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{-\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)</m>.

            <p>
                For the unit circle defined by the equation <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>, apply the derivative to both sides of this equation to get the following:
                <md>
                    <mrow> \ddx{x^2+y^2} \amp = \ddx{1} </mrow>
                    <mrow> \ddx{x^2} + \ddx{y^2} \amp = \ddx{1}</mrow>
                </md>
                Carefully consider each of these derivatives (each of the terms). Which of these will you need to apply the Chain Rule for?

                Differentiate. Solve for <m>\dydx</m> or <m>y'</m>, whichever notation you decide to use.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Make sure to use the Chain Rule when necessary!

                <m>\Ddx{y^2} = \Dd{}{y}\left(y^2\right)\Dydx = 2y\cdot \Dydx</m> or <m>2yy'</m>

                Go back to the first few questions, and try to answer them again:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find the locations of any horizontal tangent lines (where <m>\dydx=0</m>).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find the locations of any vertical tangent lines (where <m>\dydx</m> doesn't exist, or where you would divide by 0).
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Find the values of <m>\dydx</m> for the points on the circle where <m>x=\frac{1}{2}</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
