                Here's a graph of just the unit circle for angles <m>[0,\pi]</m>. We are choosing to focus on this region, since these are the angles that the inverse tangent and inverse secant functions will return to us. We want to investigate the signs of <m>\tan(y)</m> and <m>\sec(y)</m>.

                Go back to our derivative expressions for both the inverse tangent and inverse secant functions. What do we know about the signs of these derivatives?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Notice that in <m>\ddx{\tan^{-1}(x)} = \frac{1}{\sec^2(y)}</m>, we know that the derivative must be positive. Even when <m>\sec(y)\lt 0</m>, we are squaring it.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <m>\ddx{\sec^{-1}(x)} = \frac{1}{\sec(y)\tan(y)}</m>, we know that the derivative must also always be positive. Whenever <m>\sec(y)\lt 0</m>, we have <m>\tan(y)\lt 0</m>, and so the product must be positive.

                Confirm your idea about the sign of the derivatives by investigating the graphs of each function.

                How do we need to write these derivatives, when we write them in terms of <m>x</m> to account for the sign of the derivative?
