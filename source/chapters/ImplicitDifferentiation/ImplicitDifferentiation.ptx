    <title>Implicit Differentiation</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's quickly recap what we've done with this new calculus object, the derivative:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We defined the derivative at a point (<xref ref="def-DerivativeAtPoint"/>) to find the slope of a line touching a graph of a function <m>f(x)</m> at a single point. We call this the <q>slope of the tangent line</q> at a point.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Once we calculated this slope, we quickly found a way to think about the derivative as a <em>function</em> (<xref ref="def-DerivativeFunction"/>) that connects <m>x</m>-values with the slope of the line tangent to <m>f(x)</m> at that <m>x</m>-value.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We thought about how we could interpret the derivative as more than just a slope (<xref ref="sec-InterpretingDerivatives"/>). We can think about this as an instantaneous rate of change, and use it to add detail to how we think about mathematical models of different things.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We spent some time building up shortcuts, noticing patterns, and generalizing ways of finding these derivative functions for specific functions (<xref ref="sec-DerivativeRules"/>) as well as combinations of those functions (<xref ref="sec-ProductQuotientRule"/> and <xref ref="sec-ChainRule"/>).
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Our goal, now, is to generalize this a bit. What happens when we push past the restriction of only dealing with <em>functions</em>? Can we think of some reasonable <em>non-functions</em> that might produce curves? Might we think about tangent lines and slopes in these contexts?

            <title>Explicitly and Implicitly Defined Curves</title>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        A function or curve that is defined <term>explicitly</term> is one where the relationship between the variables is stated in with an equation like <m>y=f(x)</m>. Here, <m>x</m> is the input variable and we can find each corresponding value of the <m>y</m>-variable by applying some operations to <m>x</m>. As an example, we might consider the following function:
                        <me>
                            y=3x+1
                        </me>.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A function or curve that is defined <term>implicitly</term> us one where the relationship between the variables is stated with an equation connecting the variables, but not necessarily one which is solved for a single variable. Here, the relationship between variables is not stated with the typical input and output variables. As an example, we might consider the same function as above, but defined as:
                        <me>
                            y-3x-1=0
                        </me>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often, an implicitly defined curve is one where we <em>cannot</em> solve for a single variable by isolating it.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </definition>
            A classic and important implicitly defined curve is the unit circle:
            <me>
                x^2+y^2=1
            </me>.
            We can try to isolate for <m>y</m> and write this as an explicitly defined curve, and end up with:
            <me>
                y=\sqrt{1-x^2}
            </me>. 
            Unfortunately, this only displays the upper half of the circle, since the square root will only output positive values. In this case, we can get around this by defining the circle with two functions.

    <p>
        As we move forward, let's work with this circle using the implicitly defined version (<m>x^2+y^2=1</m>). How might we find a slope of a line tangent to this circle at some point?
    </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-DerivativeOperator">
        <title>Using a Derivative as an Operator</title>
        <p>
            Let's recall back to <xref ref="subsec-DerivativeNotation" text="title"/>. We talked about how we can use the notation <m>\ddx{f(x)}</m> as a kind of action: the notation says <q>find the derivative of <m>f(x)</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.</q> When we say <q>with respect to <m>x</m>,</q> we mean that we are treating <m>x</m> as an input variable, and trying to find out how <m>f</m> changes based on changes to that input. The notation says, <q>find the rate at which <m>f(x)</m> changes as <m>x</m> increases.</q>
        </p>
        <p>
            Because this notation is a call to action, we can use it when we're dealing with an equation. We can call back to our early algebra days, where we learn that whatever we do to one side of an equation needs to be done to the other side as well, in order to maintain the equality.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can apply this to our derivative actions: we can differentiate both sides of an equation!
        </p>
        <xi:include href="./activities/act-ImplicitChainRule.ptx" />
        <p>
            Because we'll be applying our derivative notation to pieces of some equation, we'll need to be very aware of where we need to apply the Chain Rule.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we can look at some examples of implicitly defined curves and think about questions about the derivative. Let's start with our circle.
        </p>

                <p>
                    Let's repeat some of this process, but using a new curve. Consider the curve defined by the equation:
                    <me>y^2=x^3-x+1</me>.
                    This curve is a special curve with some interesting mathematical properties, and is actually a part of a family of curves called <term>elliptic curves</term>. For now, let's just consider it as a fun curve to look at, and use implicit differentiation to think about it.
                </p>

                            The elliptic curve, y^2=x^3-x+1. If has a flared horseshoe type shape. The curve has a symmetry across the x-axis, and the upper section starts somewhere near (-1.3,0). It starts moving vertically upwards, and then curves towards (-1,1). From there, it descends lightly towards somewhere near (0.6, 0.6), where it flares upwards. The portion under the x-axis is a reflection of this.

                                <li>

                                        Find the locations of any horizontal tangent lines (where <m>\dydx=0</m>).

                                        Find the locations of any vertical tangent lines (where <m>\dydx</m> doesn't exist, or where you would divide by 0).

                </task>
        </example>
        <p>
            This example was pretty similar to the first activity: in both of these, we use the Chain Rule to differentiate <m>\ddx{y^2}</m>. Let's look at another example.
        </p>    
        <xi:include href="./activities/act-ImplicitSine.ptx" />
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-SummaryAndStrategy">
        <title>Some Summary and Strategy</title>
        <p>
            Let's wrap this up with some general strategy and summary of what we've seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing we can notice is that we have talked through how to employ two of the three big derivative rules: we used Chain Rule throughout these examples, and in <xref ref="act-ImplicitSine"/> we needed to use the Product Rule in order to differentiate <m>\ddx{x^2y^2}</m>. We have a glaring omission from our examples so far, though. Where is the Quotient Rule?
        </p>
        <p>
            In these implicitly defined curves, we can manipulate the equations to never have to think about division! Consider the curve:
            <me>
                \frac{\sin(x)}{x} + \frac{\sin(y)}{x} = xy^2
            </me>.
            Graph this curve in a graphing utility like desmos. Does it look any different than the curve in <xref ref="act-ImplicitSine"/>?
        </p>
        <p>
            The only difference, really, is that the curve with the division is not defined at <m>x=0</m>. As long as we keep those domain issues in mind, we can multiply everything by <m>x</m> to get our familiar equation:
            <me>
                \sin(x)+\sin(y)=x^2y^2
            </me>.
            And there we go, we never have to think about the Quotient Rule in these kinds of contexts!
        </p>
        <p>
            So we really only need a strategy for using the Chain Rule and the Product Rule.
        </p>
        <assemblage xml:id="strat-ImplicitDifferentiation">
            <title>Strategy for Implicit Differentiation</title>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We use the <em>Chain Rule</em> whenever we differentiate something like <m>\dd{}{y}\left(f(y)\right)</m>. We differentiate whatever the function is, and multiply by the derivative of <m>y</m>: <m>f'(y)y'</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This generalizes more: any time the variable in our derivative notation does not match the variable in the function/term, we need to use the Chain Rule:
                            <me>
                                \dd{}{y}\left(e^x\right) \hspace{0.7cm} 
                                \dd{}{t}\left(\sin(x)\right) \hspace{0.7cm}
                                \dd{}{x}\left(y^4\right)
                            </me>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            We use the <em>Product Rule</em> whenever we differentiate a term with some combination of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> variables. More generally, we can use the Product Rule any time we have a combination of at least two variables. We have to treat these as different kinds of functions getting multiplied!
                            <me>
                                \dd{}{y}\left(xe^y\right) \hspace{0.7cm} 
                                \dd{}{t}\left(\cos(t)\sin(x)\right) \hspace{0.7cm}
                                \dd{}{x}\left(y^4\sqrt{x+1}\right)
                            </me>

    </subsection>
    <conclusion>
        <p>
            From here on out, we will use the ideas of implicit differentiation to accomplish two things:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        We have a bit more flexibility with how we think of derivatives! We do not need to be restricted to only thinking about functions in order to think about rates of change or slopes at a point. We can think about any curve, any relationship between variables, and think about the relationship between them based on how one changes with regard to the other.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Implicit differentiation will be a very useful tool. Even when we have functions that can be written explicitly, they might be hard to deal with -- overly complex or maybe involving functions that we aren't used to. It is absolutely possible, and a really useful strategy, to re-write the relationship between variables implicitly! We can maybe create a version of these equations that we can differentiate!
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            We're going to use this second idea first: in the next section we'll be thinking about inverse functions. We do not have any idea of how to think about derivatives of logarithmic functions, like <m>y=\ln(x)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can re-write this:
            <me>
                y=\ln(x) \longleftrightarrow x=e^y
            </me>.
            This second representation is something we can differentiate!

            Similarly, if we wanted to think about the derivative of <m>y=\tan^{-1}(x)</m>, we might instead think about re-writing this:
            <me>
                y=\tan^{-1}(x) \longleftrightarrow x=\tan(y)
            </me>.
            There are some weird issues to think about with the domains and ranges of these functions, but this is how we'll approach these derivatives next.
