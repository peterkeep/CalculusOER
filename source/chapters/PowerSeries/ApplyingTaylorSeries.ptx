  <title>How to Use Taylor Series</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this final topic for this chapter, we'll pause for a moment to figure out what we could actually <em>use</em> these Taylor series for. This next statement is the personal opinion of the author: I do not typically care to focus on the applications of mathematical topics. In this text, you'll maybe notice that there is less of a focus on applications of derivatives and integrals into other areas and more focus on what these calculus objects actually are.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll try to focus on the flexible uses and applications of Taylor series as a way of allowing us the freedom to think about calculus topics in hard-to-work-with contexts, or to extend our uses of calculus ideas into new contexts.

      We have built a whole host of antidifferentiation strategies in <xref ref="ch-AntidifferentiationTechniques"/>, but there are plenty of functions that are resistant to those specific techniques. In fact, most functions do not have what we call <term>elementary antiderivatives</term>: antiderivative functions that can be written as some combination of the basic, named function types.

      A typical example is <m>\sin(x^2)</m>. Let's look at an integral involving this function!
