  <title>How to Use Taylor Series</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this final topic for this chapter, we'll pause for a moment to figure out what we could actually <em>use</em> these Taylor series for. This next statement is the personal opinion of the author: I do not typically care to focus on the applications of mathematical topics. In this text, you'll maybe notice that there is less of a focus on applications of derivatives and integrals into other areas and more focus on what these calculus objects actually are.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll try to focus on the flexible uses and applications of Taylor series as a way of allowing us the freedom to think about calculus topics in hard-to-work-with contexts, or to extend our uses of calculus ideas into new contexts.

      Taylor series have, as a part of their structure, a built-in approximation strategy. If we want to approximate a series, we can use a partial sum! Approximations of functions using Taylor series, then, are easily approximated using the polynomials that build the partial sums.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use this as a way of approximating the functions themselves or approximating function outputs (by evaluating our Taylor series at specific <m>x</m>-values).

      We have built a whole host of antidifferentiation strategies in <xref ref="ch-AntidifferentiationTechniques"/>, but there are plenty of functions that are resistant to those specific techniques. In fact, most functions do not have what we call <term>elementary antiderivatives</term>: antiderivative functions that can be written as some combination of the basic, named function types.
    </p>
    <p>
      A typical example is <m>\sin(x^2)</m>. Let's look at an integral involving this function!

    <p>
      We got lucky here, in that the alternating series was reasonable to approximate with some specified error bound (based on <xref ref="thm-ApproximatingAlternating"/>), but this isn't technically unique to alternating series! There are some other ways of building error bounds on our partial sum approximations, but we won't spend our time building them.
