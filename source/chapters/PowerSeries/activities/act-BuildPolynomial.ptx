    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to use the formula in <xref ref="def-PolynomialApproximation"/> to construct two different polynomials that approximate two different approximations. Then, we'll use them to approximate things!

        <statement>
            <p>
                We're going to start with approximating the function <m>f(x)=\sin(x)</m> centered at <m>x=0</m>.
