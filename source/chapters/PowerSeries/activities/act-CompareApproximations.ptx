    <title>How Good Are Our Approximations?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to think more carefully about our approximations of <m>\sin(1)</m> and <m>e^{-3}</m> from <xref ref="act-BuildPolynomial"/>. In order for us to do this, let's visualize the function and the 5th degree polynomial for it.

               How good of a job did the polynomial approximation do when approximating <m>\sin(1)</m>? How can you tell, visually?

                How does the relationship between the <q>center</q> and the <m>x</m>-value that we're approximating at impact the accuracy of our approximation?

                How do you think you could make these approximations better (without changing the center)?
