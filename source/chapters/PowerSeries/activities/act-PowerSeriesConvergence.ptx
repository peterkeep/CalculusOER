    <title>Some Power Series and their Convergence</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's consider a couple of power series and apply some convergence tests to them in order for us to find out how it might converge.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider the power series:
                <me>
                    \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{(x-1)^k}{k^2}
                </me>.
                In order for us to apply the Ratio Test, we'll actually need to consider the positive-term version:
                <me>
                    \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{|x-1|^k}{k^2}
                </me>.
                Apply the Ratio Test. What do you get in the limit of the ratio between terms?
