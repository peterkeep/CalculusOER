    <title>Some Power Series and their Convergence</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's consider a couple of power series and apply some convergence tests to them in order for us to find out how it might converge.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider the power series:
                <me>
                    \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(x-1)^k}{k^2}
                </me>.
                In order for us to apply the Ratio Test, we'll actually need to consider the positive-term version:
                <me>
                    \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{|x-1|^k}{k^2}
                </me>.
                Apply the Ratio Test. What do you get in the limit of the ratio between terms?                
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What kind of result from the Ratio Test guarantees convergence for the series? What are the <m>x</m>-values that guarantee convergence?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The Ratio Test is inconclusive when the limit is equal to 1. What <m>x</m>-values does this happen at? Consider the power series evaluated at each of these <m>x</m>-values. Do these series converge or diverge?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider the power series:
                <me>
                    \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(x-1)^k}{\sqrt{k}}
                </me>.
                Find the interval of <m>x</m>-values for which this series converges and test the end points of the interval in the same way as earlier. If it differs, explain why.
