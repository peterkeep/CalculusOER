    <title>Approximating <m>\pi</m> and Other Values</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's pick a couple of values that are just based on functions with <xref ref="strat-KnownSeries" text="title"/> and approximate them.

                If we note that <m>\tan^{-1}(1)=\dfrac{\pi}{4}</m>, then we can say that <m>\pi = 4\tan^{-1}(1)</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Find an infinite series that converges to <m>\tan^{-1}(1)</m>, and use that to construct a series that converges to <m>\pi</m>.

                If we note that <m>\dfrac{1}{e}=e^{-1}</m>, then find an infinite series that converges to <m>\dfrac{1}{e}</m>.

                Find an infinite series that converges to <m>\sin(1)</m>.

                Note that each of these three series are alternating series! We can approximate them using a partial sum, and then we can get an error bound for that partial sum by looking at the size of the next term in the infinite series (<xref ref="thm-ApproximatingAlternating" text="type-global-title"/>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Approximate the value of each infinite series using a partial sum with the same number of terms. You can pick the number of terms you use. Then, compare the margin of error. Which approximations are most/least accurate? Why do you think that is?
