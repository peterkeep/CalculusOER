    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's revisit our 5th degree polynomial approximations from <xref ref="act-BuildPolynomial"/>.
            <md>
                <mrow>\sin(x) \amp \approx x-\frac{x^3}{3!} +\frac{x^5}{5!}</mrow>
                <mrow>e^x \amp \approx 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} </mrow>
            </md>
            These approximations work well for <m>x</m>-values that are close to 0, but we will not be more formal than that.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Make a conjecture about what the 7th degree polynomial approximations are for each of these functions.

            <p>
                What about the 15th degree?

        <statement>
            <p>
                Make a conjecture about what the general formula would be for these terms. If you were to write these out using summation notation, what would they look like?

        <statement>
            <p>
                Why does the polynomial approximation for the sine function only have odd-exponent terms?

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Make a conjecture about what a polynomial approximation for <m>f(x)=\cos(x)</m> centered at <m>x=0</m> would be.
