        <p>
            Before we start, it might be helpful to remind ourselves of the way we have used linear functions to approximate other functions in <xref ref="sec-LinearApproximation" text="type-global-title"/>.

                    If <m>f(x)</m> is a function that is <m>n</m>-times differentiable at <m>x=a</m> (that is, the functions <m>f(a)</m>, <m>f'(a)</m>, <m>f''(a)</m>, ..., <m>f^{(n)}(a)</m> all exist), then the <m>n</m>th degree <term>polynomial approximation of <m>f(x)</m> centered at <m>x=a</m></term> is:
                    <md>
                        <mrow>p_n(x) \amp = f(a)+ f'(a)(x-a)+\frac{f''(a)}{2}(x-a)^2+...+ \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n</mrow>
                        <mrow> \amp = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k</mrow>

        <p>
            Now that we know how to build and use these, we should probably think about accuracy. Are the estimations coming from these polynomials even accurate? How do we talk about that?
        </p>
        <p>
            We won't formally define this too much for now: instead, we'll just look at things visually and see if we can figure out what might go into how we talk about accuracy of our estimations.
        </p>
        <xi:include href="./activities/act-CompareApproximations.ptx" />
        <p>
            So we have a couple of main ideas about the accuracy of our approximations. We don't need to formalize them, but we can use them as a guiding rule for how we talk about these polynomial approximations.

                            Approximations using <m>x</m>-values closer to the center are likely to be more accurate than approximations using <m>x</m>-values farther away from the center.

                            Polynomials with larger degrees give more accurate approximations than polynomials with smaller degrees at the same <m>x</m>-values.
