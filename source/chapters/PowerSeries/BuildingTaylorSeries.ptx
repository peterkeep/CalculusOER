      We saw in <xref ref="sec-PolynomialApproximation" text="type-global-title"/> that we can use the idea of a polynomial partial sum to build out a Taylor series representation for a function: we can

      A (hopefully) more useful strategy is to collect the Taylor series that we know, and then try to build a series for a function based on how that function relates. We saw this in
