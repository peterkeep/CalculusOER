    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to use Taylor series a bit more here, and we'll look at two interesting problems: one a historical relic, and the other a modern statistical result.

        <title>The Basel Problem</title>
        <p>
            The Basel Problem is the name given to a problem about infinite series, solved by Leonard Euler. 
                        
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="thm-BaselProblem">
            <title>Basel Problem</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    The sum of reciprocal squares converges, and specifically:
                    <me>
                        \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}=\frac{\pi^2}{6}
                    </me>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </theorem>
        <p>
            This result was incredible at the time of its proof for two reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        This was a longstanding question in mathematics! Mathematicians knew that this infinite series converged, but were stumped about what the value could be.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The proof of the result actually proved what a whole bunch of different <m>p</m>-series converged to.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Let's follow along with Euler's proof of this result!

                    We're going to follow along this proof, and for most of the time it might seem like we're fiddling with unrelated results and functions. By the end, we'll tie what we're doing together to show that:
                    <me>
                        \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}=\frac{\pi^2}{6}

                    <p>
                        First, consider the function <m>\displaystyle f(x) = \begin{cases} \dfrac{\sin(x)}{x} \amp \text{for } x\neq 0\\ 1 \amp \text{for }x=0\end{cases}</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Find a Taylor series representation for this function.
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <hint>
                    <p>
                        Try using the fact that:
                        <md>
                            <mrow>\sin(x) \amp = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{(-1)^k x^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!} </mrow>
                            <mrow> \amp = x - \frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\frac{x^7}{7!}+-...</mrow>
                        </md>
                        Can you divide by <m>x</m>?
                    </p>
                </hint>
            </task>

                <statement>
                    <p>
                        We're going to consider this function again, but in a different form. We're going to think about this infinite polynomial, but we'll try to write it by thinking about the factors that we expect to see, specifically when we think of the zeros of the function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So first, note that the zeros of this function, <m>\dfrac{\sin(x)}{x}</m> must occur when <m>\sin(x)=0</m>. What are the <m>x</m>-values that make <m>\sin(x)=0</m>? 
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </task>
            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        We'll use these zeros to write out the function's factors, but we're also going to make use of the fact that <m>f(0)=1</m>. This means that if <m>x=c</m> is a zero of the function, then the corresponding factor should be written as <m>\left(1-\dfrac{x}{c}\right)</m>. So, if <m>c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, ...</m> are all zeros, then we should write the function as:
                        <me>
                            f(x)=\left(1-\frac{x}{c_1}\right)\left(1-\frac{x}{c_2}\right)\left(1-\frac{x}{c_3}\right)\left(1-\frac{x}{c_4}\right)...
                        </me>
                        Use the zeros of the <m>\dfrac{\sin(x)}{x}</m> function that you found earlier to write out the factors of this.
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <hint>
                    <p>
                        It might be helpful to list the zeros in order of size, and pair them: <m>\pm\pi, \pm2\pi, \pm3\pi, \pm 4\pi...</m>
                    </p>
                </hint>
            </task>
            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Note that we have pairs of factors that are in the form <m>\left(1-\frac{x}{c}\right)\left(1+\frac{x}{c}\right)</m>. This is hopefully a very recognizable factoring pattern! It's the difference of squares! What do you get when you multiply these?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This should allow you to write your factored function from above in a slightly different way, by combining the pairs of factors using this multiplication. What does this look like?
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </task>

                    <p>
                        We are almost complete. We now have represented the function 
                        <me>f(x) \begin{cases} \dfrac{\sin(x)}{x} \amp \text{for } x\neq 0\\ 1 \amp \text{for }x=0\end{cases} </me>
                        as an infinite sum
                        <me>
                            1-\frac{x^2}{3!}+\frac{x^4}{5!}-\frac{x^6}{7!}+-...
                        </me>
                        and also as an infinite product
                        <me>
                            \left(1-\frac{x^2}{\pi^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{x^2}{4\pi^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{x^2}{9\pi^2}\right)...
                        </me>
                        We can note that the constant term is <m>1</m> in each, since it is the product of all of the constant terms in the infinite product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We know that the quadratic terms should be <m>-\frac{x^2}{6}</m> (from the infinite sum). Can you find what the quadratic term from the infinite product would be?
                    </p>
                </statement>
                <hint>
                    <p>
                        This should be the quadratic term in each factor multiplied by the constant term in each of the rest of the factors, summed together.
                    </p>
                </hint>
            </task>
            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        You should have shown that:
                        <me>
                            -\frac{x^2}{6} = -\frac{x^2}{\pi^2} - \frac{x^2}{4\pi^2} - \frac{x^2}{9\pi^2} - ...
                        </me>
                        What is the sum of <m>1 + \dfrac{1}{4} + \dfrac{1}{9} + ... \dfrac{1}{k^2}+...</m>?
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </task>
            <task>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Can you use this same strategy to find our what the sum <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^4}</m> converges to?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that we're really asking what the degree 4 terms are in each representation of the function <m>f(x)</m>.
