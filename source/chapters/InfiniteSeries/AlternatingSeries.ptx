  <title>Alternating Series and Conditional Convergence</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Before we move too far forward, let's circle back to a point made in <xref ref="subsec-WhyConditions" text="type-global-title"/>. In the <xref ref="thm-IntegralTest" text="title"/>, we required the terms of our series (and the continuous function we connected it with) to be positive. This was really just a mechanism that allowed us to say, in our proof, that the sequence of partial sums was monotonic. When we accumulate more of a positive thing, the total gets bigger. This is half of what we needed for us to employ the <xref ref="thm-MonotoneConvergence" text="title"/>. And because this is such a useful tool, we'll see more of this "positive term series" condition showing up in the tools we use to see if a series converges.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that makes this a perfect time to stop and ask a hallowed mathematical question: <em>What happens if that property isn't there?</em> What happens when our series does not only have positive terms?
    </p>
    <p>
      We definitely have fewer tools to use, since we don't get anything that relies on applying the <xref ref="thm-MonotoneConvergence" text="title"/> to partial sums. So instead, we'll take a brief detour into something we call <term>Alternating Series</term> (a series whose terms alternate in sign).

  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec-AlternatingSeries">
    <title>Defining Alternating Series, and the Main Result</title>
    <p>
      Ok so hopefully we have convinced ourselves that a series that has terms that alternate in sign might have an "easier" time converging than a series with only positive terms. Let's start with a definition (so that we can continue to refer to these types of series easily), and then move towards the main result.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-AlternatingSeries">
    <title>Alternating Series</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An infinite series <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> is called an <term>Alternating Series</term> when <m>a_k = (-1)^k|a_k|</m> or <m>a_k = (-1)^{k+1}|a_k|</m> for all <m>k=0,1,2,...</m>. That is, the sign of the terms alternates:
          <me>
            \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k = |a_0| - |a_1| + |a_2| - + ...
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      So this is the type of series we're thinking of: the terms perfectly alternate in sign. 
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        At the beginning of this section, we talked about removing conditions and seeing what happens. We are not fully generalizing to terms that are just different in sign, since we still have a specific format that the terms need to hold to: switching between positive, negative, positive negative, etc. Series that have a less consistent pattern between positive and negative signs are harder to think about, and so we will have to be satisfied with loosening the restrictions on signs of the terms without fully removing any conditions.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <p>
      Now, we will bring into focus one of the main results about alternating series before investigating these types of series (and how they converge) further.
    </p>
    <p>
      To lead into this new result, let's remind ourselves of a few things:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Remember the <xref ref="thm-DivergenceTest" text="title"/>. We, specifically, want to remember that, in general, we don't know anything about a series if <m>\displaystyle \lim_{k\to\infty} a_k=0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We have typically been looking at infinite series where we impose a further restriction on the terms: we looked at infinite series with only <em>positive</em> terms. We can get a lot more information about these series!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now we are looking at infinite series with a different kind of structure on their terms: the signs alternate. So it won't be a surprise when we get to add information about them!
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      The big idea that we'll use the extra information about these alternating series (based on how we defined them) to get more information from the limit of the terms. Normally we don't get any information when <m>\displaystyle \lim_{k\to\infty} a_k = 0</m>: the series of those terms could converge or diverge, and we can't tell! But with this new structure of the terms (the alternating signs), we'll actually be able to tell something from the limit of the terms being 0.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at it! We're going to think about visualizing the partial sums.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="fig-PartialSum-3"/>, we looked at the partial sums of an infinite series and saw how the terms made up the differences between those partial sums. We're going to think about this same picture, but think about it through the lense of:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            an alternating series (with terms that alternate in sign) where...
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            the terms of the alternating series approach 0 in the limit: <m>\displaystyle \lim_{k\to\infty} a_k = 0</m>. Note that this means that the <em>size</em> of the terms must go to 0 in the limit, <m>|a_k|\to 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-AlternatingPartial-1">
            <caption>Partial sums of an alternating series.</caption>
            <image source="./InfiniteSeries/AlternatingPartial-1.png" width="60%">

                  Red points on a plot. They are labeled S_0, S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5, S_6, ... S_n, S_(n+1). The points bounce up and down, where the even indexed points are above.

            </image>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Let's note a couple of things:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                All of the "even-indexed" terms (<m>a_0</m>, <m>a_2</m>, <m>a_4</m>, etc.) are positive, while all of the "odd-indexed" terms (<m>a_1</m>, <m>a_3</m>, <m>a_5</m>, etc.) are negative.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                This means that all of the "even-indexed" partial sums are big, while all of the "odd-indexed partial sums" are small. Our sequence of partial sums bounces up to an even-index and bounces down to an odd-index.
              </p>
              <p>
                As long as the size of the terms (the size of the differences between partial sums) is decreasing like we have pictured, then each "next" even-indexed partial sum is a bit smaller than the "previous" even-indexed partial sum. The same thing is true for the odd-indexed partial sums.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The terms themselves represent the distance between these successive partial sums: the difference between <m>S_n</m> and <m>S_{n+1}</m> is the term <m>a_{n+1}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          So, as long as the sizes of the terms are decreasing (or, as long as the distance between partial sums is decreasing consistently), then what happens when the terms (the distance between partial sums) goes to 0?
        </p>
        <p>
          The even-indexed partial sums and the odd-indexed partial sums approach each other!
        </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-AlternatingSeriesTest">
      <title>Alternating Series Test</title>   
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> is an alternating series and the size of the terms <m>|a_k|</m> is decreasing, then if <m>\displaystyle\lim_{k\to \infty} a_k = 0</m> then <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> converges.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This proof will follow the discussion before the statement of the theorem. Mostly, we will just fill in some details and provide some further justification for why what we were noticing must be true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start with the conditions of the test:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                We are considering an <xref ref="def-AlternatingSeries" text="title"/>, <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m>. For our purposes, we'll assume that we have something like
                <me>
                  \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k = |a_0| - |a_1| + |a_2| - |a_3| +-...
                </me>
                where the even-indexed terms are the positive ones. This could be flipped and it wouldn't make a difference.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The size of the terms are decreasing. That is, <m>|a_k|\lt |a_{k+1}</m> for all <m>k=0,1,2,...</m>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The limit <m>\displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty} a_k=0</m>. Note that this also means that <m>\displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty} |a_k|=0</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We're going to show that, under these conditions, the alternating series we're considering must converge. The way that we'll do this is, no surprise, by invoking <xref ref="thm-MonotoneConvergence" text="type-global-title"/>. We're going to do it by considering the partial sums in halves: the even-indexed ones and the odd-indexed ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, consider the sequence <m>\{S_{2n}\}_{n=0}^\infty = \{S_0, S_2, S_4, ...\}</m>. The difference between successive terms in this sequence (successive even-indexed partial sums) is:
          <me>S_{2n+2} - S_{2n} = -|a_{2n+1}| + |a_{2n+2}|</me>.
          Since the terms of the alternating series are decreasing in size, we know that <m>|a_{2n+2}|\lt |a_{2n+1}|</m>, which means that <m>S_{2n+2}-S_{2n}\lt 0</m>, and so <m>S_{2n} \gt S_{2n+2}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this which is to say, <m>\{S_{2n}\}_{n=0}^\infty</m> is a decreasing sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can apply the same reasoning to the sequence <m>\{S_{2n+1}\}_{n=0}^\infty = \{S_1, S_3, S_5, ...\}</m>. We know the differences between successive odd-indexed partial sums is:
          <me>
            S_{2n+3} - S_{2n+1} = -|a_{2n+3}| + |a_{2n+2}|
          </me>.
          This time, though, <m>|a_{2n+2}|\gt |a_{2n+3}|</m> and so the difference is positive:
          <m>S_{2n+3} - S_{2n+1}\gt 0</m> which means that <m>S_{2n+3} \gt S_{2n+1}</m>. The sequence <m>\{S_{2n+1}\}_{n=0}^\infty</m> is an increasing sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're getting close! We have monotonic sequences. Now we just need to show bounds, and then we'll show that each of these sequences converges. Then, we'll show that they converge to the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting an upper bound on the odd-indexed partial sums and a lower bound on the even-indexed partial sums is pretty easy. Let's consider subsequent partial sums, <m>S_{2n}</m> and <m>S_{2n+1}</m>. 
          <md>
            <mrow>S_{2n+1} - S_{2n} \amp =-|a_{2n+1}|</mrow>
            <mrow>S_{2n+1} - S_{2n} \amp \lt 0</mrow>
            <mrow> S_{2n+1} \amp \lt S_{2n}</mrow>
          </md>
          Ok so this is easy: we can just pick any odd-indexed partial sum to be the lower bound on the even-indexed partial sums, and vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          So <m>S_0</m> is an upper bound on <m>\{S_{2n+1}\}_{n=0}^\infty</m>, since every other <m>S_{2n}</m> is less than <m>S_0</m>, and all of <m>S_{2n+1}</m> partial sums are less than <m>S_{2n}</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>S_0 \amp \geq S_{2n} \amp \text{for } n=0,1,2,... </mrow>
            <mrow>S_0 \amp \geq S_{2n} \gt S_{2n+1} \amp \text{for } n=0,1,2,... </mrow>
            <mrow>S_0 \amp \gt S_{2n+1} \amp \text{for } n=0,1,2,... </mrow>
          </md>
          Similarly, we can say the same thing about <m>S_1</m> being a lower bound for the even-indexed partial sums:
          <md>
            <mrow>S_1 \amp \leq S_{2n+1} \amp \text{for } n=0,1,2,... </mrow>
            <mrow>S_1 \amp \leq S_{2n+1} \lt S_{2n} \amp \text{for } n=0,1,2,... </mrow>
            <mrow>S_1 \amp \lt S_{2n} \amp \text{for } n=0,1,2,... </mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we have shown that the sequences <m>\{S_{2n}\}_{n=0}^\infty</m> and <m>\{S_{2n+1}\}_{n=0}^\infty</m> are both monotonic and bounded and so both of these sequences must converge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we can show that they converge to the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>\{S_{2n}\}_{n=0}^\infty</m> converges, let's say that there is some number <m>S_E</m> where
          <me>
            \lim_{n\to\infty} S_{2n} = S_E
          </me>.
          Similarly, there is a number <m>S_O</m> where
          <me>
            \lim_{n\to\infty} S_{2n+1} = S_O
          </me>.
          Now we can use the fact that the limit of the terms is 0:
          <md>
            <mrow>\lim_{k\to\infty} a_k \amp=0 </mrow>
            <mrow>\lim_{n\to\infty} a_{2n+1} \amp =0</mrow>
            <mrow>\lim_{n\to\infty} \left(S_{2n+1}-S_{2n}\right) \amp=0 </mrow>
            <mrow> S_O-S_E\amp=0 </mrow>
          </md>
          So the numbers that these two sequences of partial sums converge to are actually equal to each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, finally, we know that under the conditions we started with, the alternating series must converge.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      We can actually get another result really easily from this one! It's about how we might approximate the value that an infinite series converges to.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that if a series converges, it's because the limit of the partial sums exists. So we "just" need to find what the real number, <m>S</m>, is when
      <me>
        \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k=0}^n a_k = S
      </me>.
      We said earlier, though, that this is pretty hard to do! We can always approximate this limit, though, by looking at a <em>big</em> partial sum: if the limit exists, then probably adding up the first 10,000 terms will be a pretty good approximation (since we don't expect the partial sums to change, much, as <m>n</m> gets bigger). But how many terms is enough to give us a good enough approximation?
    </p>
    <p>
      That's a hard question to answer, until we think about alternating series.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-ApproximatingAlternating">
      <title>Approximations of Alternating Series</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> is a converging alternating series, then the value <m>S</m> that the series converges to is bound between consecutive partial sums.

        <p>
          Another way of saying this is that the partial sum <m>S_n</m> approximates the actual value of <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> with a maximum error of <m>|a_{n+1}|</m>.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-ConditionalConvergence">
    <title>Convergence, More Carefully</title>
    <p>
      Let's circle back to an important point from <xref ref="act-LikelyToConverge"/>: an alternating series is more likely to converge than its positive-term counterpart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at a classic example of this: the alternating harmonic series.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-AlternatingHarmonicSeries.ptx" />
    <p>
      Let's look at another "version" of this "same" series. You'll notice that we're using scare-quotes on "version" and "same," and that's what we're going to investigate.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-RearrangedAlternatingHarmonicSeries.ptx" />
    <p>
      This is strange! We have two series that seem to be the same thing (one is just a re-arranged version of the other) that both converge, but they converge to different things!
    </p>
    <p>
      This doesn't seem to follow the <em>normal</em> rules of addition: we lose the normal associative property of addition, where the order or the way that we group terms to add typically doesn't matter. Here it does!
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out (and we won't prove this) that this type of convergence happens only for alternating series, and further it only happens for alternating series whose positive-term counterpart diverges.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-ConditionalConvergence">
      <title>Conditional (and Absolute) Convergence</title> 
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> is a converging alternating series, then we say that the alternating series <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> <term>converges conditionally</term> if <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty |a_k|</m> diverges.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, instead, the positive-term series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty |a_k|</m> converges as well, then we say that the alternating series <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> <term>converges absolutely</term>.

  <conclusion>
    <p>
      So now, for a series whose terms alternate in size, we can:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Classify whether the series converges or not (<xref ref="thm-AlternatingSeriesTest" text="type-global-title"/>).

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Further classify any converging alternating series to see whether the value it converges to is invariant to re-arrangement. (<xref ref="def-ConditionalConvergence" text="type-global-title"/>).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Approximate the value that the series converges to using the <m>n</m>th partial sum, and also include an error bound on that approximation using the <m>|a_{n+1}|</m> (<xref ref="thm-ApproximatingAlternating"/>).
