        <title>Sequences as Functions</title>
        <p>
            Before we move on to our actual goal of analyzing infinite series, we will construct infinite sequences. The big thing to remember here is that, when we build and analyze these sequences, we are are really building and analyzing functions. We want to keep this idea of sequences as functions in the forefront, since it will help us as we think about accumulating these function values into infinite series.

                <p>
                    An infinite sequence defined using an <term>explicit formula</term> is one where the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence is defined as a function output of <m>n</m>, the term's index.

                <p>
                    Using notation, we might say that <m>a_n = f(n)</m> where:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <m>a</m> is the ``name'' of the sequence (similar to how <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are common names of functions).
                            </p>

                                <m>n</m> is the index of the term, typically a non-negative integer.
                            </p>

                                <m>f(n)</m> is the function that we use to generate the terms.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                    A sequence is defined using a <term>recursion relation</term> is one where the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence is defined as a function output of the previous term, the <m>(n-1)</m>st term. The sequence also needs some initial term to base the subsequent terms from.

                <p>
                    Using notation, we might say that <m>a_{n} = f(a_{n-1})</m>.

        </definition>
        <p>
            These definitions are relatively limited. You might, for instance, know of a <em>very</em> famous sequence that is defined recursively by having each term being the sum of the <em>two</em> previous terms. Our study of sequences will be brief and all pointing towards infinite series, so there are a lot of nuances about sequences that we will skip.

                For each of the following sequences, write out the first handful of terms. There isn't a set amount, but you should write out enough to get a feel for the sequence structure and how the different ways of defining the sequences work. In each, you can start the index <m>n</m> at 1 and count upwards (<m>n=1,2,3,...</m>).

        <title>Sequence Terminology</title>
        <p>
            If a sequence is a function (and we're saying in this introductory section that it is), then we can think of all of the different terminology and adjectives that we use to describe functions. How many of them are relevant to sequences?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Continuous?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Differentiable?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Integrable?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Increasing?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Decreasing?
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            For now, we'll talk about sequences in two ways: their direction and the size of their terms.
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def-SequenceDirection">
        <title>Direction of a Sequence</title>        
            <statement>
                <p>
                    We say that a sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> is <term>increasing</term> if, for all <m>n=1,2,3...</m>, <m>a_{n+1}\gt a_n</m>. If <m>a_{n+1}\geq a_n</m> for all <m>n=1,2,3,...</m> then we say that <m>a_n</m> is <term>non-decreasing</term>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We say that a sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> is <term>decreasing</term> if, for all <m>n=1,2,3...</m>, <m>a_{n+1}\lt a_n</m>. If <m>a_{n+1}\leq a_n</m> for all <m>n=1,2,3,...</m> then we say that <m>a_n</m> is <term>non-increasing</term>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We say that <m>a_n</m> is constant if <m>a_{n+1}=a_n</m>, but this is a very boring sequence and we will likely not think terribly hard about these kinds of sequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes we might say that a sequence is <term>eventually non-increasing</term> if there is some <m>N>1</m>, and the sequence is non-increasing for <m>n=N, N+1, N+2, ...</m>, and similarly for <term>eventually non-decreasing</term>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <definition xml:id="def-Monotonic">
        <title>Monotonic Sequences</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    For the sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m>, we say that <m>a_n</m> is <term>monotonic</term> if <m>a_n</m> is either non-increasing or non-decreasing.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <definition xml:id="def-Bounded">
        <title>Bounded Sequences</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    We say that a sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> is <term>bounded below</term> if there is some real number <m>M</m> such that <m>a_n\geq M</m> for all <m>n=1,2,3,...</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly we say that a sequence <m>\{a_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> is <term>bounded above</term> if there is some real number <m>N</m> such that <m>a_n\leq N</m> for all <m>n=1,2,3,...</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a sequence has both an upper bound and a lower bound, then we often just say that the sequence is <term>bounded</term>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
            Lastly, we'll focus on the end-behavior of a sequence. We'll think about convergence of a sequence in the same way that we did for <xref ref="sec-ImproperIntegrals" text="title"/>: does the limit exist?
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def-SequenceConvergence">

                <p>
                    For the sequence <m>\{a_n\}</m>, if <m>L</m> is some real number and <m>\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = L</m>, the we say that the sequence <m>\{a_n\}</m> <term>converges</term> to <m>L</m>. If this limit does not exist, we say that the sequence <m>\{a_n\}</m> <term>diverges</term>.

                <p>
                    If <m>\{a_n\}</m> is a sequence that is both monotonic and bounded, then it must converge.
