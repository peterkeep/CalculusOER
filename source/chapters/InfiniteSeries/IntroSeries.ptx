  <title>Introduction to Infinite Series</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        Let's try to introduce the idea of an infinite series using a framework that we know and are (maybe) comfortable with: integrals!
    </p>
    <p>
        With an integral, we have a nice way of evaluating integrals of nicely behaved functions with finite limits of integration (<xref ref="thm-FTOC2" text="title"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, when we talked about improper integrals, we built a nice way to think about evaluating integrals with unbounded limits of integration (<xref ref="strat-ImproperIntegralsWidth" text="title"/>). How will we use this to think about infinite series, a sum of the infinitely many terms from an infinite sequence?
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec-PartialSums">
    <title>Partial Sums</title>
      <p>
      If we approach infinite series in a manner similar to improper integrals, then we will need to do a couple of things.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Truncate the infinite series at some finite ending point. This is what we did with the integral, when we replaced the infinity with some real number variable <m>t</m>. We might use <m>n</m> for the series "ending index."
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find a formula for this truncated/finite version. For the integrals, we could use the <xref ref="thm-FTOC2" text="title"/> for this! For series, we'll need to do something else.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Apply a limit as <m>t</m> (or <m>n</m> in the case of infinite series) goes off to infinity!
          </p>

        <p>
          For an infinite series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k</m>, we call <m>S_n = \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n} a_k</m> the <m>n</m>th <term>Partial Sum</term> of the infinite series.

        <p>
          We say that the infinite series <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k</m> <term>converges</term> to the real number <m>L</m> if the sequence <m>\{S_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> converges to <m>L</m> (where <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} S_n = L</m>), where <m>S_n = \displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n a_k</m> is the <m>n</m>th partial sum of the infinite series.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the sequence of partial sums <m>\{S_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> diverges (the limit <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} S_n</m> does not exist), then we say that the infinite series <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k</m> <term>diverges</term>.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-VisualizingPartialSums">
    <title>Visualizing the Sequence of Partial Sums</title>
    <p>
      Since we'll think about an infinite series <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> as the sequence of its partial sums, <m>\left\{\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^n a_k\right\}_{n=0}^\infty</m>, then we can think about visualizing an infinite series as really the same thing as visualizing a sequence in general (<xref ref="subsec-GraphingSequences"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's consider, as a first (visual) example, the infinite series:
      <me>
        \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{3}{k+1}
      </me>.
      We can think about the two important sequences that we'll consider:
      <me>
      \underbrace{\left\{\frac{3}{n+1}\right\}_{n=0}^\infty}_{\{a_n\}\text{, the sequence of terms}} \hspace{1cm} \text{and}\hspace{1cm} \underbrace{\left\{\sum_{k=0}^n\frac{3}{k+1}\right\}_{n=0}^\infty}_{\{S_n\}\text{, the sequence of partial sums}}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We can plot the sequence of terms, <m>\left\{\dfrac{3}{n+1}\right\}_{n=0}^{\infty}</m>, and visualize the limit <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n=0</m>. This sequence of terms converges to 0.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-PartialSum-1">
      <caption><m>\{a_n\}</m>, the sequence of terms in the series.</caption>
      <image source="./InfiniteSeries/PartialSum-1.png" width="90%">
        <shortdescription>Green points on a plot. The points descend (since the sequence is monotonically decreasing) towards a horizontal asymptote at 0. The horizontal axis of the plot is labeled n and the vertical axis is labeled a_n.</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Then, we can compare this with the plot of the partial sums, <m>\{S_n\}</m> where:
      <me>
        S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{3}{k+1}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-PartialSum-2">
      <caption><m>\{S_n\}</m>, the sequence of partial sums for the series.</caption>
      <image source="./InfiniteSeries/PartialSum-2.png" width="90%">
        <shortdescription>Red points on a plot. The points ascend (the sequence is monotonically increasing). The horizontal axis of the plot is labeled n and the vertical axis is labeled S_n.</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This image is fine, but not very good at showing how the sequence of terms and the sequence of partial sums are related to each other. We should note that each point in <xref ref="fig-PartialSum-2"/> is the accumulation of the heights of the preceding points in <xref ref="fig-PartialSum-1"/>. We can visualize this to make it easier by overlaying some information onto the plot of partial sums in <xref ref="fig-PartialSum-2"/>.

        <shortdescription>The red plot of partial sums. Between each point is a green vertical line going from the height of the previous point to the height of the next point. These are labeled a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, and then are unlableled afterwards.

    <note xml:id="note-ExplicitFormulaPartialSums">
      <title>Finding Explicit Formulas</title>
      <p>
        We had noted earlier (in <xref ref="sec-IntroSequences"/>) that it was hard to find explicit formulas (or recursion relations) for sequences where we had the first few terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        This remains true when we think about finding formulas for the sequences of partial sums. Notice that it is easy to find the location of the horizontal asymptote in <xref ref="fig-PartialSum-1"/> (by evaluating <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n</m>), but that we did not attempt to find one to for the partial sums in <xref ref="fig-PartialSum-2"/> or <xref ref="fig-PartialSum-3"/>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you'd like to try this, then we need to find a formula for <m>S_n</m>. Try to find the first several partial sums by adding up terms in the series. Then try to find a formula to predict the next partial sum. This will definitely not be easy!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, actually, this will be an impossible task. There is no closed-form formula for this. We cannot simply find <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty}S_n</m> in the way that we've found the limit of the sequence of terms.

    <p>
      These examples are a bit misleading: we often won't be able to do this kind of thing! For most infinite series, we will struggle to find an explicit formula for the <m>n</m>th partial sum. In these examples, though, we took advantage of some specific structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this first example (as well as the example in <xref ref="act-IntroSeries"/>), we noticed that because of the exponential function defining the terms, we were able to find some nice patterns in the partial sums. We'll explore this a bit more later in <xref ref="sec-CommonSeries"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in these other two examples, we noticed that once we could write each term as really a difference of two fractions that have a really similar structure, we got these "repeat" values from term to term where the opposite signs made things add up to 0. These are called "telescoping series," and they're mostly fun examples to think about partial sum formulas. We'll see some pop up later though, and Partial Fraction Decomposition is a nice trick to keep in mind for these kinds of things.
