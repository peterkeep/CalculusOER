  <title>Introduction to Infinite Series</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
        Let's try to introduce the idea of an infinite series using a framework that we know and are (maybe) comfortable with: integrals!
    </p>
    <p>
        With an integral, we have a nice way of evaluating integrals of nicely behaved functions with finite limits of integration (<xref ref="thm-FTOC2" text="title"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Then, when we talked about improper integrals, we built a nice way to think about evaluating integrals with unbounded limits of integration (<xref ref="strat-ImproperIntegralsWidth" text="title"/>). How will we use this to think about infinite series, a sum of the infinitely many terms from an infinite sequence?
    </p>

      If we approach infinite series in a manner similar to improper integrals, then we will need to do a couple of things.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Truncate the infinite series at some finite ending point. This is what we did with the integral, when we replaced the infinity with some real number variable <m>t</m>. We might use <m>n</m> for the series "ending index."
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Find a formula for this truncated/finite version. For the integrals, we could use the <xref ref="thm-FTOC2" text="title"/> for this! For series, we'll need to do something else.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Apply a limit as <m>t</m> (or <m>n</m> in the case of infinite series) goes off to infinity!
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <statement>
        <p>
          For an infinite series <m>\sum_{k=1}^\infty a_k</m>, we call <m>S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{k=n} a_k</m> the <m>n</m>th <term>Partial Sum</term> of the infinite series.
