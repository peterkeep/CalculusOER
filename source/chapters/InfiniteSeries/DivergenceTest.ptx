    <title>The Relationship Between a Sequence and Series</title>
    <p>
      We have looked at both infinite sequences and infinite series so far, and, to make things complicated, we're really thinking about an infinite series (of terms from an infinite sequence) as an infinite sequence (of partial sums of the series). We've looked at how to visualize these (in both <xref ref="subsec-GraphingSequences"/> and <xref ref="subsec-VisualizingPartialSums"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's first start with defining a new series. This is a relatively important one by itself (it <em>does</em> have its own name), but it's mostly an important series because it leads us into some new and interesting ways of thinking about series in general.

        <title>Harmonic Series</title>
        <statement>
            <p>
                We call the series 
                <me>
                    \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}
                </me>
                the <term>Harmonic Series</term>.

    <p>
      Let's continue to think about this strange series, but actually prove that the series itself diverges.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-HarmonicSeriesDiverges">
      <title>The Harmonic Series Diverges</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>Harmonic Series</term>, <m>\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}</m>, diverges.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let's assume, for the sake of eventual contradiction, that the harmonic series converges.
        </p>
      </proof>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-DivergenceTest">
      <title>Divergence Test</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For an infinite series <m>\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m>, if the infinite series converges then
          <me>
            \lim_{k\to\infty} a_k = 0
          </me>.
          This is equivalent to saying that if 
          <me>
            \lim_{k\to\infty} a_k\neq 0
          </me>
          then the infinite series <m>\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> diverges.

        Apply the Divergence Test to the following series and interpret the results.

        <statement>
          <p>
            <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{k^15 - 4k^10 + 10k^4}{e^{2k}}</m>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            We can do a couple of things here! There is a nice result about limits of polynomials that we can use in the numerator (<xref ref="thm-PolynomialEndBehavior" text="title"/>). We could also get this same result using some other techniques, like what we use to prove that theorem. Then we can use <xref ref="thm-LHopitalsRule" text="title"/> to evaluate the limit, since we have a <m>\frac{\infty}{\infty}</m> indeterminate form.
