    <title>Building our First Sequences</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We might already have some familiarity with sequences. Here, we'll focus less on some of the detailed mechanics and just think about these sequences as functions.

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Describe a sequence of numbers where you use a consistent rule/function to build each term (each number) based only on the <em>previous term</em> in the sequence. You will need to decide on some first term to start your sequence.

        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Describe a different sequence of numbers using the same rule to generate new terms/numbers from the previous one. What do you need to do to make these two sequences different from each other?

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Describe a new sequence of numbers where you use a consistent rule/function to build each term based on its position in the sequence (i.e. the first term will be some rule/function based on the input 1, the second will be based on 2, you'll use 3 to get the third term, etc.). We will call the position of each term in the sequence the <em>index</em>.

        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Describe another, new, sequence of numbers where you use a consistent rule/function to build each term based on its index. This time, make the terms get smaller in size as the index increases.
