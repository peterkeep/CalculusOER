    <title>When Are These Tests Useful?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to look at a couple of small examples where we can re-write some expressions into friendlier forms, and try to connect these re-writing strategies to the <xref ref="thm-RatioTest" text="custom">Ratio</xref> and <xref ref="thm-RootTest" text="custom">Root Tests</xref>.

                Re-write the following expression into a friendlier form. Explain why this new form is friendlier.

                    \sqrt[k]{\frac{2^{k+1}}{7^{3k}}}

                Why do you think the Ratio Test especially will be useful for series whose terms include factorials and exponentials?

            <p>
                Why do you think the Root Test will be useful for series whose terms include exponentials and functions raised to functions (of <m>k</m>)?
