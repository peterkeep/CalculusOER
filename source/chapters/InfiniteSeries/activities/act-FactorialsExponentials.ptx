    <title>When Are These Tests Useful?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to look at a couple of small examples where we can rewrite some expressions into friendlier forms, and try to connect these rewriting strategies to the <xref ref="thm-RatioTest" text="custom">Ratio</xref> and <xref ref="thm-RootTest" text="custom">Root Tests</xref>.

                Rewrite the following expression into a friendlier form. Explain why this new form is friendlier.

                    \sqrt[k]{\frac{2^{k+1}}{7^{3k}}}

                Why do you think the Ratio Test especially will be useful for series whose terms include factorials and exponentials?

                Why do you think the Root Test will be useful for series whose terms include exponentials and functions raised to functions (of <m>k</m>)?
