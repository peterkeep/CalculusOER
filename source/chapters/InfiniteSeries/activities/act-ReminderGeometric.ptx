    <title>Reminder about Geometric Series</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We are going to build some convergence tests that try to link some infinite series to the family of geometric series and show that even though a series is <em>not</em> geometric, it might act enough like one to be considered "eventually geometric-ish."
        </p>
        <p>
            But first, what does it mean for a series to be a geometric series?
        </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Describe a defining characteristic of a geometric series. What makes it geometric?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Can you describe this characteristic in another way? For instance, if you described a geometric series using a characteristic about the <xref ref="def-ExplicitFormula" text="title"/>, can you describe the same characteristic in the context of the <xref ref="def-RecursionRelation" text="title"/> instead? Or vice versa?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                What kinds of functions do we see in the formula for the terms of a geometric series?
            </p>
        </hint>
        <hint>
            <p>
                How do you describe how you might get from one term in a geometric series to the next one?
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Write out a generalized and simplified form of the term <m>a_k</m> of a geometric series explicitly and recursively. In each case, solve for <m>r</m>, the ratio between terms.
