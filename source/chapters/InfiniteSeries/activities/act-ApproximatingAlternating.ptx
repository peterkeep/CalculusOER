    <title>Approximating an Alternating Series</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's look, again, at the picture of the partial sums of an alternating series in <xref ref="fig-PartialSum-3"/>. Now, let's change this, so that the series has terms that alternate in sign. We'll start with <m>a_0</m> being positive, so that all of the "even-indexed" terms are positive and all of the "odd-indexed" terms are negative.
