    <title>Approximating an Alternating Series</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's look, again, at the picture of the partial sums of an alternating series in <xref ref="fig-AlternatingPartial-1"/>. We're going to assume that the series converges, which means that:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} S_n</m> exists.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = 0</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            Let's add to our figure.

                    Red points on a plot. They are labeled S_0, S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5, S_6, ... S_n, S_(n+1). The points bounce up and down, where the even indexed points are above. The vertical distance between each point is green and is labeled a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, ... a_n, a_(n+1). These are getting smaller as we move from point to point. This means that the red points are getting closer to a grey dashed line that cuts through the points labeled lim_(n to infinity) S_n.

            <p>
                Why are the even-indexed partial sums sitting above the odd-indexed partial sums?

        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                We started, in this case, with a positive term <m>a_0</m>, and then the rest of the signs alternate. How does this change the partial values of partial sums?

        <statement>
            <p>
                Why are the even-indexed partial sums sitting above the horizontal line, <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} S_n</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                We know that the sizes of the terms, <m>|a_n|</m>, decreases. This means that the sequence <m>\{S_0, S_2, S_4, ...\}</m> is decreasing.
            </p>
            <p>
                What does that mean about how these partial sums relate to the limit of partial sums?

                Why are the odd-indexed partial sums sitting below the horizontal line, <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} S_n</m>?

                We know that the sizes of the terms, <m>|a_n|</m>, decreases. This means that the sequence <m>\{S_1, S_3, S_5, ...\}</m> is increasing.

        <statement>
            <p>
                If we were trying to approximate the value of <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty} S_n</m>, how can we use the partial sums to build an interval that approximates the value?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Since all of the even-indexed partial sums are upper bounds of any approximation and the odd-indexed partial sums are lower bounds.  
            </p>
            <p>
                This means that any pair of partial sums serves as an approximation:

                    <mrow>S_1 \lt \amp\lim_{n\to\infty} S_n \lt S_0 </mrow>
                    <mrow>S_{2n+1} \lt \amp \lim_{n\to\infty} S_n \lt S_{2n}
                    </mrow>
