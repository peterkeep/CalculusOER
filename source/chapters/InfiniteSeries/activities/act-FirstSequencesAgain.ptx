    <title>Returning to our First Sequences</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's return back to the four sequences we created in <xref ref="act-FirstSequences"/>.

        <statement>
            <p>
                      For each of the sequences, how are we going to define them? Explicit formulas? Recursion relations? How do you know? 
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Now, for each sequence, define the sequence formally using either an explicit formula or recursion relation, whichever matches with how you described the sequence in <xref ref="act-FirstSequences"/>.
