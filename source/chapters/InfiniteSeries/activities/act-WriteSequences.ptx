    <title>Write the Sequence Rules</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We'll look at some sequences by writing out the first handful of terms. From there, our goal is to write out more terms and eventually define each sequence fully.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each sequence, write an explicit formula and a recursion relation to define the sequence. You can choose whether to start your index at <m>n=0</m> or <m>n=1</m>.

                <m>\{a_n\} = \left\{4, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{54}, ...\right\}</m>

                It might be helpful to write these numbers using a common denominator! Or at least some of the numbers.

                If you are recursively multiplying by a number each time, what will that look like in the explicit formula? How do we represent repeated multiplication?
