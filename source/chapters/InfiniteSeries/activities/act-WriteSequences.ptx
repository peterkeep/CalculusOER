    <title>Write the Sequence Rules</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We'll look at some sequences by writing out the first handful of terms. From there, our goal is to write out more terms and eventually define each sequence fully.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each sequence, write an explicit formula and a recursion relation to define the sequence. You can choose whether to start your index at <m>n=0</m> or <m>n=1</m>.

        <statement>
            <p>
                <m>\{a_n\} = \left\{4, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{9}, \frac{1}{54}, ...\right\}</m>
            </p>

                It might be helpful to write these numbers using a common denominator! Or at least some of the numbers. Alternatively, you can try a common <em>numerator</em> (which is very fun to do, since we normally don't do that).

                If you are recursively multiplying by a number each time, what will that look like in the explicit formula? How do we represent repeated multiplication?

        <statement>
            <p>
                <m>\{b_n\} = \left\{\frac{3}{5}, \frac{2}{5}, \frac{5}{17}, \frac{3}{13}, \frac{7}{37},...,\right\}</m>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You can re-write these fractions! Have any of them been "reduced?"
            </p>
        </hint>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Re-write <m>\frac{2}{5}</m> and <m>\frac{3}{13}</m> by scaling the numerator and denominator by 2. Can you find a formula for the numerator and denominator separately? This one is <em>very</em> difficult to find a recursion relation for, so feel free to only write it explicitly!
            </p>

        <statement>
            <p>
                <m>\{c_n\} = \left\{\frac{1}{5}, \frac{3}{5}, 1, \frac{7}{5},...\right\}</m>       
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>

                This one will definitely be helpful to re-write so that all fractions have a common denominator.

                If you are recursively adding something, how does that show up in the explicit formula? How do we repeatedly add?

                What kinds of connections do you notice between the explicit formulas and the recursion relations for these sequences?
