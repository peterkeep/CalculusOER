    <title>Which is More Likely to Converge?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to try to think about what might be different when we analyze an alternating series compared to a series with only positive (or non-negative) terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's say that <m>\{a_k\}_{k=0}^\infty</m> is some sequence of positive real numbers. Now let's consider the two series:
        <md>
            <mrow> \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k \amp \amp \text{vs} \amp \amp \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k a_k</mrow>
        </md>
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let's first consider the sequences of terms: <m>\{a_k\}</m> compared with <m>\{(-1)^k a_k\}</m>. Is either of these more or less likely to converge? Does this tell us anything about whether or not the corresponding series converges?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Try thinking about how we might find <m>\displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty} (-1)^k a_k</m>, especially using the <xref ref="thm-SqueezeTheorem" text="title"/>.
            </p>
        </hint>
        <hint>
            <p>
                What does the <xref ref="thm-DivergenceTest" text="title"/> say? Is either of these sequences more or less likely to converge to 0 (or not)?
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Now let's think of the partial sums:
                <md>
                   <mrow>\left\{\sum_{k=0}^n a_k\right\}_{n=0}^\infty \amp \amp \text{vs} \amp  \amp \left\{\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k a_k\right\}_{n=0}^\infty </mrow>
                </md>   
                Is either of these sequences more or less likely to converge? Does this tell us anything about whether or not the corresponding series converges?          
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                It might be helpful to plot these partial sums! Referencing a picture like <xref ref="fig-PartialSum-3"/> and think about how this will change the plot of partial sums for terms that alternate in sign.
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Now make a conjecture about which infinite series is more likely to converge:
                <md>
                    <mrow> \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k \amp \amp \text{vs} \amp \amp \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k a_k</mrow>
                </md>
                Remember that <m>a_k\gt 0</m> for <m>k=0,1,2,...</m>, so the only differences are the changes in sign.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Remember that series convergence is defined by the behavior of the sequence of partial sums!
            </p>
