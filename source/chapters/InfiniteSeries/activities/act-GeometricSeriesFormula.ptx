    <title>Building a Convergence Formula for Geometric Series</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to think of constructing two different ways of thinking about how much area of of a circle has been shaded. We can pretend we have a circle with area that is 1, where the radius is <m>r=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}}</m>, giving 
            <me>A=\pi\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{\pi}}\right)^2 = 1</me>. 
            Then we can describe the areas we're looking at as almost a percentages of the total area.
        </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                We are going to split our circle into two parts, with <m>r</m> amount of the area left unshaded and so <m>1-r</m> area shaded. We'll shade in some angular sector.

                This part is easy: how much of the area is shaded?

                This next step will set the stage for how we think about this problem now: we're going to divide the remaining white area up into the same proportional pieces: we'll shade in a ratio of <m>1-r</m> of the remaining white space and leave a ratio of <m>r</m> of the white space unshaded.

                Can you describe two ways of calculating the total amount of shaded area?

        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                It could be helpful to consider how much area has been shaded or to not consider how much unshaded area is left over.

    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                We'll repeat the process: shade in more, where the ratio of shaded area to unshaded area is <m>1-r</m> to <m>r</m>.

                Now we're going to repeat this process until we've done it a total of <m>n+1</m> times.

                In the limit as <m>n\to\infty</m>, how much of the area is shaded in?
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice that <m>(1-r)</m> is likely a common factor in one of your ways of calculating this area. Convince yourself, then, that:

                    <mrow>\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=0}^n r^k \amp = \lim_{n\to\infty} (1+r+r^2+...+r^n) </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{1-r}</mrow>
