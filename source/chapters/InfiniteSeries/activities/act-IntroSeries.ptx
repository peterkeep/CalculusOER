    <title>How Do We Think About Infinite Series?</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>Let's consider the following sequence:
        <me>
            \left\{\frac{9}{10^n}\right\}_{n=1}^\infty
        </me>
        </p>        
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                White out the first 5 terms of the sequence.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What does this sequence converge to? Show this with a limit!       
            </p>

        <statement>
            <p>
                Now we'll construct a new sequence, this time by adding things up. We're going to be working with the sequence <m>\{S_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> where
                <me>
                    S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{k=n} \left(\frac{9}{10^k}\right)
                </me>.
                Write out the first five terms of this sequence: <m>S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Can you come up with an explicit formula for <m>S_n</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Does <m>\{S_n\}</m> converge or diverge? Use a limit to find what it converges to!
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What do you think this means for the infinite series <m>\sum_{k=1}^\infty \left(\frac{9}{10^k}\right)</m>? Does the infinite series converge or diverge?
