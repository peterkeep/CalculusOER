    <title>Exploration: Infinite Series</title>
    <p>
        We've seen a lot of infinite series examples, and we have a lot of tools for how to think about infinite series. Take a look at some more examples that are a bit strange to think about.

                <p>
                    Consider the series
                    <me>
                        \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{D(k)k^p}
                    </me>
                    where <m>D(k)</m> is the function that returns the number of digits in the number <m>k</m> (so <m>D(9)=1</m> and <m>D(435)=3</m>), and <m>p</m> is a real number.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    For what values of <m>p</m> does this series converge?

                    where <m>F(k)</m> is the function that returns the <m>k</m>th Fibbonacci number, and <m>p</m> is a real number. As a reminder, the Fibbonacci sequence is:

                        1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...

                    where <m>F(k)=F(k-1)+F(k-2)</m>.
