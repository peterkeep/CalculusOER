        <p>
            We've seen a lot of infinite series examples, and we have a lot of tools for how to think about infinite series. Take a look at some more examples that are a bit strange to think about.

            In this chapter, we've analyzed infinite sums of function-generated values. A natural extension is to think about an infinite product of function-generated values. We can define this using some notation, and work on building some preliminary results.

                    For a sequence of real numbers, <m>\{a_k\}_{k=1}^\infty</m>, the <term>infinite product</term>
                    <me>
                        \prod_{k=1}^\infty a_k = (a_1)(a_2)(a_3)(a_4)\cdots
                    </me>
                    We define this as a sequence of <term>partial products</term>, similar to how we define an infinite series as a sequence of partial sums.

                        \prod_{k=1}^\infty a_k = \left\{\prod_{k=1}^n a_k\right\}_{n=1}^\infty
