    <title>Infinite Series As a Kind of Integral</title>
    <p>
      Let's start here with a connection between objects. We've already thought about the connection between an infinite series and the sequence of terms of the series (<xref ref="thm-DivergenceTest" text="type-global-title"/>). Now we'll think about the connections between two objects that are similar to each other in that they both represent an accumulation of function values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier (in <xref ref="subsec-SequencesAsFunctions" text="title"/>) we tried to describe sequences as just a special kind of function: the domain is the set of non-negative integer (or positive integers, depending on whether we start our index at <m>n=0</m> or <m>n=1</m>) and we map these inputs to real number outputs. And now we want to think about what it might mean to accumulate the values of these kinds of functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Function value accumulation is what we've been looking at lately! That's what integration is! We are trying to accumulate all of the function values and weigh them based on their <q>width.</q> In the context of continuous functions, that means we start approximating this accumulation by looking at some finite number of function values that we pick, and we give them some <m>\Delta x</m> width between them. That's our Riemann sum:
      <me>
        \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*) \; \Delta x
      </me>
      And from there, we work on making that space between function values get smaller (as the number of function values we use gets higher). So when <m>n</m> is the number of function values, we can let <m>n\to \infty</m> and correspondingly we get <m>\Delta x \to dx</m>, the differential in our integral:
      <me>
        \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k^*) \;\Delta x = \int_{x=a}^{x=b}f(x)\;dx
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is how we've talked about infinite series so far, even adopting the same notions of convergence and thinking about how we extend a familiar idea (in this case adding numbers, compared to integrating a function) out to infinity: we just keep walking our (finite) ending point out to infinity using a limit!
    </p>
    <p>
      So this brings us to this comparison of the same types of objects across these two different contexts.

      So in this section, we'll investigate this link between infinite series and improper integrals as the same kind of object occurring in different contexts. Intuitively, then, they'll be related to each other, under the right conditions.

    <title>The Integral Test</title>
    <p>
      The Integral Test is really about connecting the behavior of an integral and a series, and the way that we'll do it is by trying to visualize what an infinite series is (a sum of function values, where the function inputs are spaced apart by 1) and linking that to a Riemann sum. From there, we'll use the <xref ref="thm-MonotoneConvergence" text="title"/> on the sequence of partial sums to show that the series converges.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-IntegralTest.ptx" />
    <theorem xml:id="thm-IntegralTest">
      <title>Integral Test</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> is an infinite series with <m>a_k\gt 0</m> for all <m>k\geq 0</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is a continuous and decreasing function with <m>f(k) = a_k</m> for all <m>k\geq 0</m>, then we can compare the behaviors of <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> and <m>\displaystyle\int_{x=0}^\infty f(x)\;dx</m>: the integral and the series are guaranteed to either both diverge or both converge.
        </p> 
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The proof of this will come in two parts. First, we'll prove that <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> converges when <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^\infty f(x)\;dx</m> converges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, we'll prove that <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> diverges when <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^\infty f(x)\;dx</m> diverges.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Let's start with the assumption that <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^\infty f(x)\;dx</m> converges. We know, based on <xref ref="def-ConvergenceImproperIntegral"/>, that this means that <m>\displaystyle \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{x=0}^{x=n} f(x)\;dx</m> exists. We also know, since <m>f(x)\gt 0</m>, that 
                <me>
                  \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{x=0}^{x=n} f(x)\;dx \gt \int_{x=0}^{x=n} f(x)\;dx
                </me>.
                This means:
                <md>
                  <mrow>\sum_{k=0}^n a_k \amp\lt a_0 + \int_{x=0}^{x=n} f(x)\;dx </mrow>
                  <mrow>\sum_{k=0}^n a_k \amp \lt a_0 + \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{x=0}^{x=n} f(x)\;dx </mrow>
                  <mrow>\sum_{k=0}^n a_k \amp \lt a_0 + \int_{x=0}^\infty f(x)\;dx</mrow>
                </md>
                This means that the partial sum, <m>\displaystyle S_n = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k</m> has an upper bound.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also know that, since <m>a_k\gt 0</m> for all <m>k=0,1,2,...</m>, then <m>S_{n+1}\gt S_n</m>. This means that the sequence of partial sums, <m>\{S_n\}_{n=0}^\infty</m> is both monotonic and bounded, and therefore must converge (by the <xref ref="thm-MonotoneConvergence" text="title"/>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> converges.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Now, we can start with the assumption that the integral <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^\infty f(x)\;dx</m> diverges. Since we know that <m>f(x)</m> is positive, then we know that
                <me>
                  \lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{x=0}^{x=n} f(x)\;dx = \infty
                </me>.
                We can reconsider the inequalities from <xref ref="act-IntegralTest"/>:
                <md>
                  <mrow>\int_{x=0}^{x=n} f(x)\;dx \amp\lt \sum_{k=0}^n a_k </mrow>
                  <mrow>\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_{x=0}^{x=n} f(x)\;dx \amp \lt \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{k=0}^n a_k</mrow>
                  <mrow>\infty \amp\lt \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k </mrow>
                </md>
                So then <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> must also diverge.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          This is everything we need to prove! Note that we could replicate this proof by swapping the role of the series and the integral to get the same conclusion.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      So now we have a more formal link between these two objects. We have some intuition from <xref ref="tbl-IntegralSeries"/> that these are pretty similar objects: one of them is an accumulation of function values in a continuous context, while the other is an accumulation of function values in a discrete context.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can think about this even more formally! We reminded ourselves at the beginning of this section that, when we think about the limit of a Riemann sum (in the <em>continuous context</em>) that as <m>n\to\infty</m>, we get <m>\Delta x \to dx</m>, where <m>dx</m> is essentially the distance between inputs. This produces our integral.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, in the <em>discrete context</em>, we have something different. Without being too formal, we can think about the corresponding limit of <m>\Delta k</m> as we slice this up further. Because our functions are in the discrete context, our inputs have a minimum distance between each other: they're all 1 unit apart! So here, in the limit where we expect <m>\Delta x\to dx</m>, we get <m>\Delta k\to 1</m>. And similarly, in a typical definite integral, we are adding up an infinite number of function outputs between some starting input and stopping input. Now in the discrete context, we don't get that! We get our normal partial sum: 
      <me>
        \sum_{k=0}^n a_k \underbrace{\Delta k}_{1} = \sum_{k=0}^n a_k
      </me>.
      So the <xref ref="thm-IntegralTest" text="title"/> is pretty obvious, really: these corresponding objects retain the same type of behavior when we translate them back and forth between the continuous context and the discrete context.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great! Let's apply this, now.
    </p>

          For each of the following infinite series, decide whether it is possible (and reasonable) to use the Integral Test. If it is, apply the test and interpret the conclusions.

          <p>

        <hint>
          <p>
            This would connect with the integral <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^\infty \frac{1}{x^2+1}\;dx</m>. Does the function, <m>f(x)=\dfrac{1}{x^2+1}</m>, meet the requirements of the Integral Test? Does it look like something you could antidifferentiate?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            This is a fine opportunity to apply the Integral Test. The Integral Test says that we can link the behavior of the integral and the series:
            <me>
              \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2+1} \sim \int_{x=0}^\infty \frac{1}{x^2+1}\;dx
            </me>.
            Let's think about the integral!
            <md>
              <mrow>\int_{x=0}^\infty \frac{1}{x^2+1}\;dx \amp = \lim_{t\to\infty}\int_{x=0}^{x=t}\frac{1}{x^2+1}\;dx</mrow>

              <mrow> \amp = \frac{\pi}{4}</mrow>
            </md>
            This integral converges.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Conclusion:</em> Since the integral <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^\infty \frac{1}{x^2+1}\;dx</m> converges, we know that the infinite series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2+1} </m> also converges.

        <statement>
          <p>
            <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^{k^2}}</m>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            We can rewrite <m>\dfrac{1}{e^{k^2}}</m> to <m>e^{-k^2}</m>, and so we're thinking about the integral <m>\displaystyle\int_{x=0}^\infty e^{-x^2}\;dx</m>. Does this function meet the conditions of the Integral Test? Can we antidifferentiate?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, this integral is going to be very difficult for us! The function <m>f(x)=e^{-x^2}</m> has an antiderivative on the interval <m>[0,\infty)</m> (it's a continuous function, and so it is integrable according to the <xref ref="thm-FTOC1" text="title"/>).
          </p>
          <p>
            This function, though, doesn't have what we call an <term>elementary antiderivative</term>: any antideriative of <m>e^{-x^2}</m> can't be written as a combination of our basic function types.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that we're unable to integrate this using our typical techniques, and (for now), we don't know if the integral converges or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Conclusion:</em> We won't apply the Integral Test, and so we don't know whether the series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{e^{k^2}}</m> converges or not.

      As we develop more strategies and tests for series convergence, we should pause and summarize our test.

         We want to use this for functions that are relatively easy to antidifferentiate. Looking for <m>u</m>-substitution is a good idea, and sometimes we can straightforwardly apply integration by parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll find, though, that this test will mostly be used to introduce a family of infinite series and build up our intuition about partial sums (since we're really using the integrals to find a bound on our monotonic sequence of partial sums).

            <em>Positive:</em> We need <m>f(x)</m> and <m>a_k</m> to be positive in order for us to get monotonic sequences. Since we know that <m>a_k\gt 0</m>, we guarantee ourselves that <m>S_{n+1}\gt S_n</m>, since we're really adding another positive term. The same thing is true for the integrals, where we guarantee that
            <me>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^{x=n+1} f(x)\;dx \gt \int_{x=0}^{x=n} f(x)\;dx</me>.

        <li>

            <em>Decreasing:</em> This one serves two purposes. First, we use the direction of the function to get some ideas on how the Left and Right Riemann sum compare to the areas: with a decreasing function, the Left sum will always overestimate the integral while the Right sum will underestimate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We could have just required our function to be <term>monotonic</term>, though, since that would guarantee that one of those Riemann sums overestimated the integral while the other underestimated it: we really don't care about the order. So why would we need it, specifically, to be decreasing? Easy: if <m>\{a_k\}</m> is positive and <em>increasing</em>, then <m>\displaystyle\lim_{k\to\infty} a_k \neq 0</m>, and we can just apply the <xref ref="thm-DivergenceTest" text="title"/>.

        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Continuous:</em> This one is pretty simple. Continuity guarantees that an antiderivative of our function exists on the interval we're looking at. We might not be able to actually find it easily, but at least we know there is one! Without continuity, we can't antidifferentiate easily and it doesn't make sense to think about the integral.

      We talked about why it's nice to have a monotonic sequence of terms, but what happens when they aren't? Briefly, we can say that there are plenty of examples where the series and the integral may not behave similarly. For an easy to see example, let's consider the following series:
      <me>
        \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \sin^2(\pi\cdot k)
      </me>.
      If we try to think about the corresponding integral, we're considering:
      <me>
        \int_{x=0}^\infty \sin^2(\pi\cdot x)\;dx
      </me>.
      Can you see what the problem is? The issue becomes evident when we plot the sequence of terms and the continuous function on the same axes.

    <p>
      We can see that if we define the sequence of terms using <m>a_k=\sin^2(\pi\cdot k)</m>, then <m>a_k = 0</m> for <m>k=0,1,2,...</m>. This means that
      <me>
        \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \sin^2(\pi\cdot k) = 0 + 0 + 0 + ... = 0
      </me>.
      Meanwhile, we can see that the integral <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^\infty \sin^2(\pi\cdot x)\;dx</m> will diverge to <m>\infty</m>, since every oscillation adds the same positive area over and over. The limit will not exist!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Integral Test, and in general, we want to (and need to) be careful about the conditions we apply: we want them to be general enough that we can actually use the test, but specific enough to protect against strange counter-examples.

      Overall, we're really just trying to connect an integral in one context to an integral in another context. We have talked, briefly, about how we can think of an infinite series as a kind of improper integral for some discrete function (since we are summing up the function values multiplied by the minimal distance between inputs).
    </p>

      Earlier (in <xref ref="sec-uSubstitution" text="type-global-title"/> and <xref ref="sec-TrigSub" text="type-global-title"/>), we tried to visualize the variable substitutions (with <xref ref="fig-uSub"/>, <xref ref="fig-uSubDefinite"/>, and <xref ref="fig-TrigSub"/>) as a translation of functions between one context and another. We can visualize the Integral Test in a similar way: we're translating our integral from a Discrete context into a Continuous context, figuring out whether the integral converges in this context, and then taking the conclusions and applying them to the integral in the Discrete context.

              Two rectangles, one labeled "Discrete Context" and the other, beside it, labeled "Continuous Context." Inside the "Discrete Context" rectangle is an infinite series with an arrow pointing towards "Existence of limit of partial sums". Inside the "Continuous Context" rectangle is an improper integral with an arrow pointing towards "Existence of limit of definite integral". There is an arrow connecting the infinite series in the first rectangle to the improper integral. Then there is an arrow connecting the statements about the existence of limits.

      In both the discrete context and the continuous context, we care about whether the limit of the partial sum (or the limit of the definite integral) exists. Under the conditions of the Integral Test, though, we can translate our infinite series to the continuous context and represent it as a traditional improper integral. If we can get conclusions about whether the improper integral converges or not (based on the behavior of the limit of the definite integral), then we can bring that conclusion back to the discrete context and apply it to the limit of the partial sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process works both ways! We could use information about an infinite series to learn about whether the corresponding improper integral converges or not! But for now, we are likely much more confident working with the integral in the continuous context, and so it makes most sense to think about the Integral Test using the directions pictured in <xref ref="fig-IntegralTest"/>.
