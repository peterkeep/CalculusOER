  <title>Comparison Tests</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, our strategies for thinking about infinite series have been focused around drawing a connection between the infinite series we care about and some other mathematical object:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <xref ref="thm-DivergenceTest" text="title"/> draws a connection (even thought it's a limited one) between the terms of the series and the series itself.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <xref ref="thm-AlternatingSeriesTest" text="title"/> draws a (stronger) connection between the terms of, specifically, an <xref ref="def-AlternatingSeries" text="title"/> and the series itself.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <xref ref="thm-IntegralTest" text="title"/> draws a connection between the series and a corresponding integral.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Now we'll work on building the most important series convergence test mechanism: we'll draw a link between the series we care about and some other series that we already know about.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is helpful for three reasons:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            We already have a couple of types of series that we know about (<xref ref="sec-CommonSeries"/>), and we can keep adding to that list.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We can take advantage of similar structure or common term formulas when we see them to essentially say, "This series kind of looks like one that I recognize. I wonder if they act the same?"
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We don't always have to integrate things using the Integral Test! Integrating can be hard! 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec-ComparingPartialSums">
    <title>Comparing Partial Sums</title>
    <p>
      We're going to start by trying to do the same thing we did when we build the <xref ref="thm-IntegralTest" text="title"/>: show that the partial sums are monotonic and bounded and then make use of the <xref ref="thm-MonotoneConvergence" text="title"/>.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-Comparison.ptx" />
    <p>
      This is it! We have everything we need to construct another link: this time between the infinite series we care about and another infinite series that we think acts the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate what we've done, let's think about two sequences of terms: <m>\{a_k\}_{k=0}^\infty</m> and <m>\{b_k\}_{k=0}^infty</m> where <m>a_k\leq b_k</m> for <m>k\geq 0</m>. We can think of the graphs, pictured below.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-ComparisonTest-Terms">
      <caption>The "smaller" sequence of terms <m>\{a_k\}_{k=0}^\infty</m> graphed alongside the "bigger" sequence of terms <m>\{b_k\}_{k=0}^\infty</m>.</caption>
      <image source="./InfiniteSeries/ComparisonTest-Terms.png" width="80%">
        <shortdescription>A sequence of green dots, labeled {b_k}, decreasing to the horizontal axis. There is a second sequence of red dots, labeled {a_k}, also decreasing to the horizontal axis. At some point, the green dots look like they're on top of the red ones.</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Now we can think about the graphs of these partial sums. Let's first think about what might happen if the series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty b_k</m> converges. We'll plot the partial sums, and the sequence of partial sums has to converge to something. But then we can think about the sequence of partial sums from the <m>a_k</m> terms: the smaller terms, of course, will build smaller partial sums.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-ComparisonTest-Converge">
      <caption>Comparison of partial sums when <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty b_k</m> converges.</caption>
      <image source="./InfiniteSeries/ComparisonTest-Converge.png" width="80%">
        <shortdescription>A sequence of green dots, labeled {partial sum of b_k}, increasing to a horizontal line. The line is labeled as the limit of the partial sums of b_k. There is a second sequence of red dots, labeled {partial sums of a_k}, also increasing but below the green dots.</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      So we can pretty easily use <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=0}^n b_k</m> as an upper bound on the sequence <m>\displaystyle \left\{\sum_{k=0}^n a_k\right\}_{n=0}^\infty</m>! And now we can say that the sequence of partial sums for <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> is monotonic and bounded, and so it must converge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we can ask about the diverging case. This time, we'll say that the smaller series, <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> diverges.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-ComparisonTest-Diverge">
      <caption>Comparison of partial sums when <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> diverges.</caption>
      <image source="./InfiniteSeries/ComparisonTest-Diverge.png" width="80%">
        <shortdescription>A sequence of green dots, labeled {partial sum of b_k}, increasing to seemingly infinity. There is a second sequence of red dots, labeled {partial sums of a_k}, also increasing to seemingly infinity, but below the green dots.</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>
    <p>
      We can think that this "smaller" sequence of partial sums is "pushing" the "larger" sequence of partial sums up to infinity with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two cases make up our first comparison mechanic between two infinite series.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-DirectComparisonTest">
        <title>Direct Comparison Test</title>        
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> and <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty b_k</m> are infinite series with positive terms (<m>a_k\gt 0</m> and <m>b_k\gt 0</m> for <m>k\geq 0</m>) with the ordering <m>a_k \leq b_k</m> for <m>k\geq 0</m>, then:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> diverges, then <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty b_k</m> also diverges.

              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty b_k</m> converges, then <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k</m> also converges.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>
      <p>
        At the end of <xref ref="sec-CommonSeries" text="type-global-title"/>, we referenced the series:
        <me>
          \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3+1}
        </me>.
        Let's use our new test!
      </p>
      <example xml:id="ex-FirstComparisonIntuition">
        <statement>
          <p>
            Does the series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3+1}</m> converge or diverge? How do you know?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            If we're going to use our new <xref ref="thm-DirectComparisonTest" text="title"/>, we need to identify two things:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Some intuition on whether we think our series converges or not.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  An appropriate series to compare to. Likely, this will be either a <xref ref="def-GeometricSeries" text="title"/> or a <xref ref="def-pSeries" text="title"/>, since we have clear convergence criteria for each of those.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            We can do this in any order: sometimes we might use the structure of the series we're looking at to give us a good candidate to compare to, and that might tell us the behavior we think we're looking for. Other times we might have good intuition about convergence/divergence of the series which will tell us whether we need to find a series that is smaller or larger to compare to.
          </p>
          <p>
            What do you think? Do we have a suitable comparison?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Compare to the <xref ref="def-pSeries" text="title"/> <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}</m>. Here, <m>p=3</m>. Based on this, do we need to show that <m>\dfrac{1}{k^3+1}</m> is greater than or less than <m>\dfrac{1}{k^3}</m>?
          </p>
          <p>
            Show this!
          </p>
          <p>
            Does the change in the starting index matter?
          </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Let's compare our series to the converging <m>p</m>-series with <m>p=3</m>:
            <me>
              \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3+1}\sim \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}
            </me>.
            We want to show that <m>\dfrac{1}{k^3+1}\leq \dfrac{1}{k^3}</m> for <m>k\geq 1</m>. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's start with comparing the denominators, and move from there.
            <me>
              k^3+1 \gt k^3 \text{ for any value of } k
            </me>
            Now we can think about reciprocals:
            <me>
              \frac{1}{k^3+1} \lt \frac{1}{k^3} \text{ for all } k\geq 1
            </me>.
            This means that, since <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}</m> converges, then <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3+1}</m> must also converge.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can just add the term where <m>k=0</m> to get
            <md>
              <mrow>\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3+1} \amp = \overbrace{\frac{1}{0^3+1}}^{k=0} + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3+1}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3+1}</mrow>
            </md>
            So then we know that our series, <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3+1}</m> must converge.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <p>
        A quick note: in this example, we thought about building the link
        <me>
          \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3+1} \sim \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}
        </me>
        and then arguing that changing the index to start at <m>k=0</m> by adding in a single term wouldn't change the behavior of the infinite series.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, we don't need to add in that last argument. We can assume from here on out that changing our starting index won't impact the behavior of the series (as long as we're avoiding things like division by 0 and such). So showing that <m>\dfrac{1}{k^3+1}\lt \dfrac{1}{k^3}</m> for <m>k\geq 1</m> is enough for us!
      </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-UnhelpfulComparisons">
  <title>(Un)Helpful Comparisons</title>
  <xi:include href="./activities/act-UnhelpfulComparisons.ptx" />
  <p>
    There are some ways around this. When we find a comparison that we think is reasonable, but has the wrong inequality for us to make a conclusion, we can do one of two things:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Try a different comparison.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Try a different test.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    We'll address the second strategy momentarily.
  </p>
  <note>
    <p>
      In fact, we might argue that we could start with a different test! It might be more useful to skip using the <xref ref="thm-DirectComparisonTest" text="title"/> in favor of just using the <xref ref="thm-LimitComparisonTest" text="title"/>, which we'll see soon, or the <xref ref="thm-RatioTest" text="title"/> or <xref ref="thm-RootTest" text="title"/>, which we'll talk about in the next section.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that the only real reason to think about the Direct Comparison Test is that
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sometimes it can be pretty quick to use. Sometimes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            It is much easier to see <em>why</em> it works, since we can make a nice argument about monotonic and bounded sequences of partial sums. From there, the Limit Comparison Test (coming up next) isn't a big jump conceptually. But it might be harder to start with.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </note>
  <p>
    So let's think about one of the series from <xref ref="act-UnhelpfulComparisons"/>:
    <me>
      \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{2k}{3^k}
    </me>
    We, intuitively, tried to compare this a related geometric series:
    <me>
      \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{2k}{3^k} \sim \underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{2}{3^k}}_{\text{converges}}
    </me>
    Unfortunately, we weren't able to make this connection, since <m>\dfrac{2k}{3^k} \geq \dfrac{2}{3^k}</m> for <m>k=1,2,3\ldots</m>
  </p>
  <p>
    We could, instead, still think that this is a converging series but compare it to the converging <m>p</m>-series, <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}</m>. We'll actually compare it to  <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{2}{k^2}</m>, but this will converge as well (since the coefficient will just scale the value that the series converges to).
  </p>
  <p>
    Note, first, that <m>3^k \geq k^3</m> for <m>k\geq 3</m>. At <m>k=3</m> we have <m>3^3=3^3</m>, but after this intersection point, the exponential will be larger than the power function.
    <md>
      <mrow>3^k \amp \geq k^3 \text{ for } k=3,4,5,...</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{1}{3^k} \amp \leq \frac{1}{k^3} \text{ for } k=3,4,5...</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{2k}{3^k} \amp \leq \frac{2k}{k^3} \text{ for } k=3,4,5...</mrow>
      <mrow>\frac{2k}{3^k} \amp \leq \frac{2}{k^2} \text{ for } k=3,4,5...</mrow>
    </md>
    And there we go! We have <m>\dfrac{2k}{3^k} \leq \dfrac{2}{k^2}</m> for <m>k=3,4,5...</m> and <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=3}^\infty \frac{2}{k^2}</m> converges, so then <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=3}^\infty \frac{2k}{3^k}</m> must also converge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, we can add two more real numbers (when <m>k=1</m> and <m>k=2</m>), and the resulting series will still converge. So, <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{2k}{3^k}</m> converges, just like we originally thought.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's not get ahead of ourselves: this quick change from one comparison to another is rarely easy! Here are some questions we can ask:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Where did <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}</m> come from? How could we have anticipated that as being useful?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Didn't we think, originally, that this was <em>almost</em> a geometric series? Why are we switching to comparing to a <m>p</m>-series?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Is there some systematic way for us to think about what to compare to? Something other than appealing to growth rates?
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    These questions will remain largely unanswered in this text, other than the following (unhelpful) solution: getting good at thinking about inequalities and comparisons means that inequalities and comparisons become easier.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not intended to be a self-indulged brag: <em>I am not that good at thinking about inequalities and comparisons either!</em> It's just meant to have you confront the fact that this test, while understandable, is not always useful in practice. There are better paths forward!
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's follow those instead.
  </p>
</subsection>
<subsection xml:id="subsec-LimitComparison">
  <title>Limit Comparison</title>
  <p>
    Let's revisit some of our intuition from earlier. When we talked about the series in <xref ref="ex-FirstComparisonIntuition"/>, we made the claim that it probably acted like the <m>p</m>-series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3}</m>. Why did we choose this series?
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, how did we pick our comparisons in <xref ref="act-UnhelpfulComparisons"/>?
  </p>
  <p>
    We had thought about what parts of the functions defining the terms of the series would take over as <m>k\to\infty</m>. We were thinking about which parts of these terms ends up dominating, in behavior, over the other parts.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're thinking about limits, really!
  </p>
  <p>
    We're going to use this intuition that we have about limits and relative growth rates to come up with another way of thinking about whether two things act similarly. There are a few ways that we could approach this, but it will be useful to think about this comparison of relative growth rates as ratios.
  </p>
  <p>
    What if we think about the ratio of the functions defining the terms of the series we're comparing, and see how this ratio acts in the limit as <m>k\to\infty</m>?
  </p>
  <xi:include href="./activities/act-RatiosForComparison.ptx" />
  <p>
    So we have three outcomes of our comparisons using ratios of functions in the limit:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The numerator function could, eventually, be so much larger than the denominator function that the limit of the ratio is infinite.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The denominator could, eventually, be so much larger than the numerator function that the limit of the ratio is zero.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The numerator and denominator could, eventually, act so similarly to each other (or like scaled versions of each other) that the limit is some real number that isn't 0. 
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    This is the motivation for the next comparison test! We'll just think about the functions defining the terms of a series instead, and we'll make conclusions about the series themselves instead of the functions defining the terms.

          What happens, in the limit as <m>k\to\infty</m> to <m>e^{1/k}</m>? How does <m>\sqrt{k^2+k}</m> act in the limit: does the <m>k</m> term influence much, compared to <m>k^2</m>?

      </hint>
      <hint>
        <p>
          One of the comparisons we can try is to link the behavior of these two series:
          <me>
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{e^{1/k}}{\sqrt{k^2+k}} \sim \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^2}} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          In order to link these series, we'll apply a limit comparison test:
          <me>
            \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{e^{1/k}}{\sqrt{k^2+k}} \sim \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{k^2}} = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}
          </me>.
          So let's investigate the limit of the ratio of the terms.
          <md>
            <mrow>\lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{\left(\frac{e^{1/k}}{\sqrt{k^2+k}}\right)}{\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)} \amp = \lim_{k\to\infty} \left(\frac{e^{1/k}}{\sqrt{k^2+k}}\right)\left(\frac{k}{1}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{ke^{1/k}}{\sqrt{k^2+k}}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \left(\underbrace{\lim_{k\to\infty} e^{1/k}}_{\to e^0 = 1} \right)\left(\lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{k}{\sqrt{k^2+k}}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{k}{\sqrt{k^2+k}} </mrow>
          </md>
          This limit is one that we can think about using <xref ref="thm-PolynomialEndBehavior" text="type-global-name"/>: we can apply the limit in the denominator under the root, and notice that the whole thing is really dependent on the behavior of <m>k^2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll apply a technique that is used in the proof of the theorem.
          <md>
            <mrow> \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{k}{\sqrt{k^2+k}}\amp = \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{k}{\sqrt{k^2\left(1+\frac{k}{k^2}\right)}}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{k}{\sqrt{k^2}\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{k}}}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{k}{k\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{k}}}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{k}}}</mrow>
          </md>
          Now, since <m>\dfrac{1}{k}\to 0</m> as <m>k\to\infty</m> we end up with:
          <me>
            \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{\left(\frac{e^{1/k}}{\sqrt{k^2+k}}\right)}{\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)} = 1
          </me>.
          <em>Conclusions:</em> Since we're comparing our series to the diverging <m>p</m>-series <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k}</m>, and the limit comparison test says that these two infinite series must have the same behavior (since the limit of the ratio of the term functions was 1), then we can conclude that the infinite series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{e^{1/k}}{\sqrt{k^2+k}}</m> also diverges.

          This is a hard one to come up with a reasonable comparison. Try writing out some terms and getting a feel for what kinds of things are happening structurally:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Is there something you can describe, recursively, about how we get from one term in the series to the next?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Are there consistent operations that we're applying to terms?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Does this remind you of anything?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </hint>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can compare this to a converging geometric series, <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^k}</m>. So, we want to draw the following link:
          <me>
            \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} \sim \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^k}
          </me>.
          The limit comparison test follows as such:
          <md>
            <mrow>\lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{\left(\frac{1}{k!}\right)}{\left(\frac{1}{2^k}\right)} \amp  = \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{2^k}{k!}</mrow>
          </md>
          We cannot use L'Hopital's Rule here, since <m>k!</m> is not a continuous function for real numbers (since it only takes in non-negative integer inputs) and so it is not differentiable.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can, instead, appeal to growth rates: <m>k!</m> approaches infinity much faster than <m>2^k</m>, and so this fraction has a much larger denominator.
          <me>
            \lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{2^k}{k!} = 0
          </me>.
          <em>Conclusions:</em> By the Limit Comparison Test, this means that <m>\frac{1}{k!} \lt \lt \frac{1}{2^k}</m>, and so, since <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^k}</m> is a converging geometric series, then the infinite series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}</m> must also converge.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </task>
  </example>
  <p>
    There isn't anything special about the series we're comparing to: We could have used any mix of the following comparisons to find the same conclusions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{e^{1/k}}{\sqrt{k^2+k}} \sim \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} \sim \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}</m>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!} \sim \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{10^k}</m>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    There's no magic series to compare to: one of the nice things about the limit comparison test is that we can compare a series to another one not based on similar structure, but based on intuited behavior: if you think a series converges, compare it to a converging <m>p</m>-series if you'd like!
  </p>
  <p>
    There certainly are some instances where it is reasonable to pick a specific series to compare to based on the structure.

    <title>Rational Comparison Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>a_k</m> is a rational function of <m>k</m>,  <m>a_k = \dfrac{p(k)}{q(k)}</m> where both <m>p(k)</m> and <m>q(k)</m> are polynomial functions, then:

  <note>
    <p>
      We can extend this result pretty easily by loosening up the "rational function" requirement. If we have combinations of power functions (even with non-integer exponents), this works as well!
