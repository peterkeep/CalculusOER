  <title>Comparison Tests</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far, our strategies for thinking about infinite series have been focused around drawing a connection between the infinite series we care about and some other mathematical object:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <xref ref="thm-DivergenceTest" text="title"/> draws a connection (even thought it's a limited one) between the terms of the series and the series itself.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <xref ref="thm-AlternatingSeriesTest" text="title"/> draws a (stronger) connection between the terms of, specifically, an <xref ref="def-AlternatingSeries" text="title"/> and the series itself.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <xref ref="thm-IntegralTest" text="title"/> draws a connection between the series and a corresponding integral.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Now we'll work on building the most important series convergence test mechanism: we'll draw a link between the series we care about and some other series that we already know about.

      This is helpful for three reasons:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            We already have a couple of types of series that we know about (<xref ref="sec-CommonSeries"/>), and we can keep adding to that list.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We can take advantage of similar structure or common term formulas when we see them to essentially say, "This series kind of looks like one that I recognize. I wonder if they act the same?"
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We don't always have to integrate things using the Integral Test! Integrating can be hard! 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
