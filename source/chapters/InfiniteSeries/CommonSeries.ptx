  <title>Common Series Types</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this section, we'll stop and recap some of the common series types that we should recognize moving forward. We'll look at the structure of these series (mainly the functions defining the <em>terms</em> of the series) as well as the convergence criteria for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look back to <xref ref="act-IntroSeries"/>. We noticed that we were able to find an explicit formula for the <m>n</m>th partial sum, which allowed us to evaluate <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}S_n</m>. We noticed this again in <xref ref="ex-geometric"/>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But there are some differences between <em>why</em> we were able to find formulas for the <m>n</m>th partial sum in each of these examples. Let's first focus on the infinite series with terms defined by exponential functions.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec-GeometricSeries">
    <title>Geometric Series</title>
    <p>
      We're going to name these series and define them explicitly. The name, <term>geometric</term>, comes from the idea of a <term>geometric mean</term>: each term in the series is the geometric mean of the term before it and after it.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <p>
        The geometric mean is a way of finding a kind of average. Instead of adding up the values and dividing by the number of values, we multiply the values and then take an <m>n</m>th root, where <m>n</m> is the number of things averaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, a geometric mean of the numbers 1, 4, and 5 is:
        <me>
          \sqrt[3]{1\cdot 4\cdot 5} = \sqrt[3]{20}
        </me>
        This is approximately 2.714. We can compare that to the arithmetic mean:
        <me>
          \dfrac{1+4+5}{3} = \dfrac{10}{3}
        </me>.
        These are just different kinds of measures of <q>center</q> of a list of values, although you might be most familiar with the arithmetic mean.
      </p>
    </aside>
    <definition xml:id="def-GeometricSeries">
    <title>Geometric Series</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> with <m>a, r \neq 0</m>, we say that the series
        <me>\sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^k = a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ...</me>
        is a <term>geometric series</term>. We call <m>r</m> the <term>constant ratio</term> and <m>a</m> the <term>initial term</term>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      We noticed in <xref ref="sec-IntroSeries" text="type-global-title"/> that these kinds of series, with their exponential structure in the terms, make it relatively easy to find patterns or explicit formulas for the partial sums. Since we can find a formula for <m>S_n</m> based on <m>n</m>, we can find <m>\displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}S_n</m>. This was something we noted then, and said that it was a pretty rare property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's generalize this a bit, and come up with a general formula for these partial sums. Once we have that, we will be able to find out what any geometric series converges to (if it does converge).
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-GeometricSeriesFormula.ptx" />
    <p>
      In order for us to move towards a formal statement of the geometric series convergence criteria, we can note that in the above activity, <m>0\leq r \lt 1</m>. We can extend this to negative values, with <m>|r|\lt 1</m>. We also can note that we could scale the area, maybe call it <m>a</m>, to get a similar formula.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-GeometricSeries">
      <title>Geometric Series Convergence Criteria</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A geometric series <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=0}^\infty ar^k</m> converges to <m>\dfrac{a}{1-r}</m> when <m>|r|\lt 1</m> and diverges if <m>|r|\geq 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec-pSeries">
    <title><m>p</m>-Series</title>
    <p>
      Another type of structure that we can take advantage of is power functions. This way, we can leverage the <xref ref="thm-IntegralTest" text="title"/> (since antidifferentiating using the <xref ref="thm-PowerRuleAntiderivatives" text="title"/> will be easy) to classify whether or not these series converge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's start by naming these. We'll focus on power functions with negative exponents, or reciprocal power functions.
    </p>
    <definition xml:id="def-pSeries">
    <title><m>p</m>-Series</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For a real number <m>p</m>, we say that the series
          <me>\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p}</me>
          is a <term><m>p</m>-series</term>. We mostly will be concerned about the case where <m>p\gt 0</m>, making the terms of the series be reciprocal power functions.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      Now, we just need to think about integration, and the convergence classification comes quickly from there.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-pSeries">
      <title><m>p</m>-Series Convergence Criteria</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <m>p</m>-series <m>\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p}</m> converges when <m>p\gt 1</m> and diverges when <m>p\leq 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Let's divide this into four cases: when <m>p\leq 0</m>, when <m>0\lt p \lt 1</m>, when <m>p=1</m>, and when <m>p\gt 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p><em>Case 1: <m>p\leq 0</m></em></p>
        <p>
          Note that for <m>\frac{1}{k^p}</m> with <m>p\lt 0</m>, we can write this as <m>k^{|p|}</m>. Now we can consider the limit of the terms, in order to use the <xref ref="thm-DivergenceTest" text="title"/>.
          <me>\lim_{k\to\infty} \frac{1}{k^p} = \lim_{k\to \infty} k^{|p|}</me>
          Since this limit is non-zero (since it is either <m>\infty</m> or 1, depending on whether <m>p=0</m> or not), the series diverges by the Divergence Test.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Case 2: <m>0\lt p\lt 1</m></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          When <m>0 \lt p \lt 1</m>, we can apply the <xref ref="thm-IntegralTest" text="title"/> to the series. It is worth showing that the conditions of the test are met, but this is left up to the reader.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now we will consider the integral <m>\int_{x=1}^\infty \frac{1}{x^p}\;dx</m> as a way of seeing whether the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p}</m> converges or diverges.
        
          <md>
            <mrow> \int_{x=0}^\infty \frac{1}{x^p}\;dx\amp = \lim_{t\to\infty}\int_{x=1}^{x=t} \frac{1}{x^p}\;dx</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{t\to\infty} \left(\frac{x^{1-p}}{(1-p)}\right)\bigg|_{x=1}^{x=t}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{t^{1-p}}{1-p} - \frac{1}{1-p}</mrow>
          </md>
          We can note that since <m>0\lt p \lt 1</m>, that <m>1-p\gt 0</m>. This means that when <m>t\to\infty</m>, <m>t^{1-p}\to\infty</m> as well.
          <me>
            \int_{x=0}^\infty \frac{1}{x^p}\;dx\ = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{t^{1-p}}{1-p} - \frac{1}{1-p} = \infty
          </me>
          This integral diverges, and so then does the series.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Case 3: <m>p=1 </m></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the <xref ref="def-HarmonicSeries" text="title"/>! This series diverges (<xref ref="thm-HarmonicSeriesDiverges"/>).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Case 4: <m>p\gt 1</m></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          We can repeat the proof from <em>Case 2</em>, but we will end with a different conclusion based on the sign of the exponent! Let us, again, apply the Integral Test.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the integral <m>\int_{x=1}^\infty \frac{1}{x^p}\;dx</m> as a way of seeing whether the series <m>\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^p}</m> converges or diverges.
        
          <md>
            <mrow> \int_{x=0}^\infty \frac{1}{x^p}\;dx\amp = \lim_{t\to\infty}\int_{x=1}^{x=t} \frac{1}{x^p}\;dx</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{t\to\infty} \left(\frac{x^{1-p}}{(1-p)}\right)\bigg|_{x=1}^{x=t}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{t^{1-p}}{1-p} - \frac{1}{1-p}</mrow>
          </md>

          Now, though, we have <m>p\gt 1</m> which means that <m>1-p \lt 0</m>. This means that <m>t^{1-p} = \frac{1}{t^{|p-1|}}</m>. So now we will consider the limit, and note that as <m>t\to\infty</m>, we get <m>\frac{1}{t^{|p-1|}}\to 0</m>.
          <me>
            \int_{x=0}^\infty \frac{1}{x^p}\;dx\ = \lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{1}{(1-p)t^{|p-1|}} - \frac{1}{1-p} = -\frac{1}{1-p}
          </me>
          This integral converges, and so then does the series. We remember, though, that the series converges to something different than the integral, and so we do not know what the series converges to.
        </p>
      </proof>

  <title>Recapping Our Mathematical Objects</title>
  <p>
    It's a good idea to pause and try to make sure we understand what these infinite series are. We have talked a lot about a whole bunch of objects in this chapter so far: infinite sequences, partial sums, sequences of partial sums, infinite series, integrals, limits, etc. We want to make sure that we can keep track of the ways in which we use these and talk about them. The following activity is brief, but can help make sure we understand some of the interactions we've talked about so far.
  </p>
  <xi:include href="./activities/act-ImpossibleCombinations.ptx" />
</subsection>
<conclusion>
  <p>
    Moving forward, we'll want to commit these families of series to memory, as well as their convergence criteria.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's some justification: for an infinite series like <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2+1}</m>, we previously (in <xref ref="ex-InvTanSeries"/>) compared this series to the integral <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2+1}\;dx</m>. This worked well, since we could pretty easily antidifferentiate and conclude that the integral converged.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, though, we have another connection to make: doesn't this series <em>almost</em> look like a <xref ref="def-pSeries" text="title"/>? It's very close to a reciprocal power function, where the only thing that's <q>off</q> is the <q><m>+1</m></q> in the denominator.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can hopefully think about changing this example slightly: what about the series <m>\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k^3+1}</m>? This one could still be compared to the integral <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=0}^\infty \frac{1}{x^3+1}\;dx</m>, but this integral will be harder for us to integrate. But if we think about this as <em>almost</em> a <xref ref="def-pSeries" text="title"/>, then we might still be able to have some intuition about it's behavior: it <em>looks</em> kind of like a converging <m>p</m>-series, so shouldn't it also converge?
  </p>
  <p>
    Our next section will develop this kind of comparison, where instead of comparing an <q>integral</q> in the discrete context to one in the continuous context (like we do in the <xref ref="thm-IntegralTest" text="title"/>), we can compare an <q>integral</q> in the discrete context to a similar one in a similar context.
