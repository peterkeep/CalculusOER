  <title>Some Early Derivative Rules</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We are going to break this topic into two parts:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            We will try to find some common patterns or connections between derivatives and specific functions. For instance, when we use <xref ref="def-DerivativeFunction" text="type-global-title"/> to build a derivative, are there patterns in the work of evaluating that limit that will allow us to get through the limit work quickly? Can we group some functions together based on how we might deal with the limit?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We will try to think about derivatives a bit more generally and show how we can build some basic properties to help us think about differentiating variations of the functions that we recognize.
          </p>

    <p>
      There is a really nice theorem that helps to understand how the <m>(x+\Delta x)^n</m> multiplication goes (for different positive integer exponents, <m>n</m>) called the Binomial Theorem, but we won't introduce it here, fully. What we'll do, instead, is summarize the results:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            In each term, the exponents on <m>x</m> count down from <m>n</m> to <m>0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Similarly, in each term, the exponents on <m>\Delta x</m> will count up from <m>0</m> to <m>n</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The coefficients for each term are generated from a very cool pattern, displayed below.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

        (x+\Delta x)^5 = x^5+5x^4\Delta x + 10x^3\Delta x^2 + 10x^2\Delta x^3 + 5 x\Delta x^4 + \Delta x^5

      We can now think of each row, and figure out what was happening in the limit work we did.
      <ol>
          <li>
              <p>
                  The first term of that multiplication will combine with the subtraction of <m>x^n</m> in the numerator and subtract to 0.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can designate this in the triangle by shading in the first term in red.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  The rest of the terms in the multiplication have at least one copy of <m>\Delta x</m>, and so we can factor out <m>\Delta x</m> and <q>cancel</q> it with the <m>\Delta x</m> in the denominator. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We can designate the terms in the triangle without any remaining <m>\Delta x</m>'s in them by shading the second term in green. The rest, that have at least one <m>\Delta x</m> in it, are shaded in blue.
              </p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>
                  Once this has done, we've escaped the portion of the limit that was giving us the <m>\frac{0}{0}</m> indeterminate form, and so we can evaluate the limit as <m>\Delta x\to 0</m>. The result is just that whatever terms still have at least one remaining copy of <m>\Delta x</m> in it <q>go to</q> 0, and we're left with just the terms that do not have any copies of <m>\Delta x</m> in them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that all of the blue terms go to <m>0</m> in the limit, and we are left with the green terms, but without any <m>\Delta x</m>. Since these are the second terms, we have the coefficient and one fewer exponent on <m>x</m>.

      <proof>
        <p>
          In order to show why <m>\dfrac{d}{d\theta}\left(\sin(\theta)\right) = \cos(\theta)</m> and <m>\dfrac{d}{dx}\left(\cos(\theta)\right) = -\sin(\theta)</m>, we will work with the limit definitions of both. Consider both:
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\sin(\theta)\right) \amp = \lim_{\Delta \theta \to 0}\left(\frac{\sin(\theta+\Delta \theta)-\sin(\theta)}{\Delta \theta}\right)</mrow>

          </md>
          Our goal is to rewrite the numerators in both of these limits as something more usable. So far, we have been evaluating these types of limits (<xref ref="sec-IndeterminateForms" text="title"/>) using some algebraic manipulations. Instead of using algebra, we will use geometry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the unit circle below. We have plotted the angle <m>\theta</m> and are reminded that the point on the circle that corresponds with the terminal side of the angle <m>\theta</m> has coordinates <m>(\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta))</m>. We can label the sides of the triangle pictured below.

          Now we consider a second point on the circle, this one formed by the terminal side of the angle <m>(\theta+\Delta \theta)</m>. This point has coordinates <m>(\cos(\theta+\Delta \theta), \sin(\theta+\Delta \theta))</m>. Note, below, that we want to find expressions for <m>\sin(\theta+\Delta\theta)-\sin(\theta)</m> and <m>\cos(\theta+\Delta\theta) - \cos(\theta)</m>. We can find these geometrically.

            <shortdescription>A triangle on a unit circle, with standard lengths 1, sin(theta), and cos(theta). Another point is labeled on the unit circle. There is a triangle formed by the line connecting the two points, and then the vertical and horizontal components of the distance between the two points. The vertical distance is labeled sin(theta+Delta theta)-sin(theta) and the horizontal distance is labeled cos(theta)-cos(theta+Delta theta). The hypotenuse is labeled h, but it is very close to the same as the arclength between the two points, labeled Delta theta.</shortdescription>

        </figure>
        <p>
          Note, then, that the two triangles look to be similar triangles. We can say, then, that:
          <md>
            <mrow>\sin(\theta+\Delta\theta)-\sin(\theta)\amp \approx h\cos(\theta) </mrow>
            <mrow>\cos(\theta)-\cos(\theta+\Delta\theta)\amp \approx h\sin(\theta) </mrow>
          </md>
          In fact, we will find that in the limit as <m>\Delta \theta\to 0</m>, the length <m>h</m> matches the arc length <m>\Delta \theta</m> perfectly, and thus lays at a right angle to the terminal side of the angle <m>\theta+\Delta \theta</m>. Since as <m>\Delta \theta\to 0</m> we have <m>h\to\Delta \theta</m>, we can say:
          <md>
            <mrow> (\sin(\theta+\Delta\theta)-\sin(\theta))\amp\to \Delta \theta \cos(\theta)</mrow>
            <mrow> (\cos(\theta)-\cos(\theta+\Delta\theta))\amp\to \Delta \theta \sin(\theta)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider, then, the limits involved in the derivative calculations that we built earlier.
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\sin(\theta)\right) \amp = \lim_{\Delta \theta\to 0}\left(\frac{\sin(\theta+\Delta \theta)-\sin(\theta)}{\Delta \theta}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =\lim_{\Delta \theta \to 0} \left(\frac{\Delta \theta \cos(\theta)}{\Delta \theta}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{\Delta \theta \to 0} (\cos (\theta))</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \cos(\theta)</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{d}{d\theta}\left(\cos(\theta)\right) \amp = \lim_{\Delta \theta \to 0}\left(\frac{\cos(\theta+\Delta \theta)-\cos(\theta)}{\Delta \theta}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{\Delta \theta \to 0}\left(\frac{-(\cos(\theta)-\cos(\theta+\Delta \theta)) }{\Delta \theta}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{\Delta \theta \to 0}\left(\frac{-\Delta \sin(\theta)}{\Delta \theta}\right)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \lim_{\Delta \theta \to 0} (-\sin(\theta))</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = -\sin(\theta)</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we have shown that <m>\dfrac{d}{d\theta}(\sin(\theta)) = \cos(\theta)</m> and <m>\dfrac{d}{d\theta}(\cos(\theta)) = -\sin(\theta)</m> as we claimed.

      We can think about each of these properties through the lense of how combining these functions impacts the slopes. For instance, if we wanted to visualize the property about coefficients (that <m>\ddx{kf(x)}=k\ddx{f(x)}</m>), we can visualize this coefficient as a scaling factor.
