                For each of the following functions, use the definition of the derivative at a point to find <m>f'(a)</m> and then find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember: The equation of a line given the slope <m>m</m> and <m>(x_1, y_1)</m>, a point on the line is <m>y=m(x-x_1)+y_1</m>.

                We start watching a car driving down a straight road towards a stop sign. We can tell that their position function is <m>s(t) = -7.5t^2 + 81t</m> with position measured in feet from their location when we began observing them and time measured in seconds.

                The monetary value of an ancient mathematical artifact (the pencil that Isaac Barrow used to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in 1667) follows the function <m>m(t) = \sqrt{1600t}+10</m> where <m>t</m> is the number of years since 1667 and <m>m(t)</m> is the monetary value of the pencil in US Dollars.
