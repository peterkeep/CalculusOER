  <title>The Product and Quotient Rules</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We saw in <xref ref="thm-CombinationsOfDerivatives" text="type-global-title"/> that when we want to find the derivative of a sum or difference of functions, we can just find the derivatives of each function separately, and then combine the derivatives back together (by adding or subtracting). This, hopefully, is pretty intuitive: of course a slope of a sum of things is just the slopes of each thing added together!
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we want to think about derivatives of product and quotients of functions. What happens when we differentiate a function that is really just two functions multiplied together?
    </p>

    <xi:include href="./activities/act-MotivatingProductRule.ptx" />
    <p>
        A thing that I like to think about is this: if <m>\Ddx{f(x)g(x)} = f'(x)g'(x)</m>, then every function's derivative would be 0.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example with the <m>\sin(x)</m> function, we noticed that we could write the function as <m>(1)(\sin(x))</m>. This is true of every function!
    </p>
    <p>
        If <m>\Ddx{f(x)g(x)} = f'(x)g'(x)</m>, then we could say that for any function <m>f(x)</m> with a derivative <m>f'(x)</m>:
        <md>
            <mrow>\ddx{f(x)} \amp = \ddx{1\cdot f(x)}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \ddx{1}\ddx{f(x)}</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = 0 \cdot f'(x)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =0</mrow>
        </md>.

        This, obviously, can't be true! We know of <em>tons</em> of functions that have non-zero slopes...<em>most</em> of them do! 
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we hopefully have some motivation for building a rule to that helps us think about derivatives of products of functions.

    <title>What about Dividing?</title>
    <p>
      So we can differentiate a product of functions, and the obvious next question should be about division: if we needed to build a reasonable way of differentiating a product, shouldn't we also need to build a new way of thinking about derivatives of quotients?
    </p>
    <p>
      A nice thing that we can do is think about division as really just multiplication. For instance, if we want to differentiate <m>\Ddx{\dfrac{\sin(x)}{x^2}}</m>,
      then we can just think about this quotient as really a product:
      <me>
        \ddx{\frac{\sin(x)}{x^2}} = \ddx{\frac{1}{x^2}\left(\sin(x)\right)}
      </me>.
      Now we can just apply product rule!
      <md>
        <mrow>\ddx{\frac{1}{x^2}\left(\sin(x)\right)} \amp =\ddx{x^{-2}\sin(x)}</mrow>
        <mrow>u = \sin(x) \amp \;\;\; v = x^{-2} </mrow>
        <mrow>u'=\cos(x) \amp \;\;\; v'=-2x^{-3}</mrow>
        <mrow> \ddx{\sin(x)x^{-2}}\amp  = x^{-2}\cos(x) + (-2x^{-3}\sin(x))</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \frac{\cos(x)}{x^2} - \frac{2\sin(x)}{x^3}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This works great! We can <em>always</em> think about quotients as just products of reciprocals! But the problem is that we can't always differentiate these reciprocals (for now). We were able to differentiate <m>\dfrac{1}{x^2}</m> by re-writing this as just a power function (with a negative exponent).
    </p>
    <p>
      What about this flipped example:
      <me>
        \ddx{\frac{x^2}{\sin(x)}}
      </me>?
      In order for us to do the same thing, we need to re-write this as
      <me>
        \ddx{x^2\left(\sin(x)\right)^{-1}}
      </me>
      but we don't know how to differentiate <m>\left(\sin(x)\right)^{-1}</m> (yet).
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's try to build a general way of differentiating quotients.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-QuotientRule.ptx" />
    <p>
      This formula is fine, but a little clunky. We'll try to re-write it in some nice ways, but it is a bit more complex than the <xref ref="thm-ProductRule" text="title"/>.

      <title>Quotient Rule</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>u(x)</m> and <m>v(x)</m> are differentiable at <m>x</m> and <m>f(x) = \dfrac{u(x)}{v(x)}</m> then:
          <me>
            f'(x) = \dfrac{v(x)u'(x) - u(x)v'(x)}{(v(x))^2}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For convenience, this is often written as:
          <me>
            \ddx{\frac{u}{v}} = \frac{vu'-uv'}{v^2}

            Once you have this derivative, confirm that it is the same as <m>\dfrac{\cos(x)}{x^2} - \dfrac{2\sin(x)}{x^3}</m>, the way that we found it using the Product Rule.
