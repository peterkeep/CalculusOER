    <title>Composition (and Decomposition) Pictionary</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            This activity will involve a second group, or at least a partner. We'll go through the first part of this activity, and then connect with a second group/person to finish the second part.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Build two functions, calling them <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>. Pick whatever kinds of functions you'd like, but this activity will work best if these functions are in a kind of sweet spot between <q>simple</q> and <q>complicated,</q> but don't overthink this.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Compose <m>g(x)</m> inside of <m>f(x)</m> to create <m>(f\circ g)(x)</m>, which we can also write as <m>f\left(g(x)\right)</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Write your composed <m>f\left(g(x)\right)</m> function on a separate sheet of paper. Do not leave any indication of what your chosen <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are. Just write your composed function by itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, pass this composed <m>f\left(g(x)\right)</m> to your partner/a second group.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                You should have received a new function from some other person/group. It is different than yours, but also labeled <m>f\left(g(x)\right)</m> (with different choices of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Identify a possibility for <m>f(x)</m>, the outside function in this composition, as well as a possibility for <m>g(x)</m>, the inside function in this composition. You can check your answer by composing these!
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Write a different pair of possibilities for <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> that still will give you the same composed function, <m>f\left(g(x)\right)</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Check with your partner/the second group: did you identify the pair of functions that they originally used?
            </p>
            <p>
                Did whoever you passed your composed function to correctly identify your functions?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
</activity>
