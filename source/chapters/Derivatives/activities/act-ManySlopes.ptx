    <title>Calculating a Bunch of Slopes</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's do this all again, but this time we'll calculate the slope at a bunch of different points on the same function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's use <m>j(x)=x^2-4</m>.

                Start calculating the following derivatives, using the definition of the <xref ref="def-DerivativeAtPoint" text="title"/>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>j'(-2)</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>j'(0)</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>j'(1/3)</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>j'(-1)</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </statement>

                Stop calculating the above derivatives when you get tired/bored of it. How many did you get through?       
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Notice how repetitive this is: on one hand, we have to set up a completely different limit each time (since we're looking at a different point on the function each time). On the other hand, you might have noticed that the work is all the same: you factor and cancel over and over. These limits are all ones that we covered in <xref ref="sec-IndeterminateForms" text="type-global-title"/>, and so it's no surprise that we keep using the same algebra manipulations over and over again to evaluate these limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you notice any patterns, any connections between the <m>x</m>-value you used for each point and the slope you calculated at that point? You might need to go back and do some more.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Try to evaluate this limit in general:
                <md>
                    <mrow> j'(a)\amp= \lim_{x\to a}\left(\frac{j(x)-j(a)}{x-a}) </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \lim_{x\to a} \left(\frac{(x^2-4)-(a^2-4)}{x-a}\right)</mrow>
                </md>.
                Remember, you know how this goes! You're going to do the same sorts of algebra that you did earlier!
            </p>
            <p>
                What is the formula, the pattern, the way of finding the slope on the <m>j(x)</m> function at any <m>x</m>-value, <m>x=a</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Confirm this by using your new formula to re-calculate the following derivatives:  
                 <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>j'(-2)</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>j'(0)</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>j'(1/3)</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>j'(-1)</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>     
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <conclusion>
        <p>
            We're going to try to think about the derivative as something that can be calculated in general, as well as something that can be calculated at a point. We'll define a new way of calculating it, still a limit of slopes, that will be a bit more general.
