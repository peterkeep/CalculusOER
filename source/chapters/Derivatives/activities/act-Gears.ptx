    <title>Gears and Chains</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's think about some gears. We've got three gears, all different sizes. But the gears are linked together, and a small motor works to spin one of the gears. Since the gears are linked, when one gear spins, they all do. But since they are different sizes, they complete a different number of revolutions: the smaller ones spin more times than the larger ones, since they have a smaller circumference.

                <shortdescription>Three circles, each with a point on it spinning around. The first circle is the largest: it is labeled "Gear A." The second circle is the smallest: it is labeled "Gear B." The last circle is a medium size: it is labeled "Gear C."</shortdescription>

            For our purpose, let's say that Gear A is being driven by the motor.

                Let's try to quantify how much "faster" Gear B is spinning compared to Gear A. How many revolutions does Gear B complete in the time it takes Gear A to complete one revolution?

                Now quantify the speed of Gear C compared to its neighbor, Gear B. How many revolutions does Gear C complete in the time it takes Gear B to complete one revolution?

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Use the above relative "speeds" to compare Gear C and Gear A: how many revolutions does Gear C complete in the time it takes Gear A to complete one revolution?
            </p>
            <p>
                More importantly, how do we find this?

        <statement>
            <p>
                Now let's translate this into some derivative notation: we've really been finding rates at which one thing changes (the speed of the gear spinning) relative to another's.
            </p>
            <p>
                Call the speed of Gear B compared to Gear A: <m>\dd{B}{A}</m>. Now call the speed of Gear C compared to Gear B: <m>\dd{C}{B}</m>. Come up with a formula to find <m>\dd{C}{A}</m>.
