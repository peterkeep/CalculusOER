    <title>Constructing a Quotient Rule</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to start with a function that is a quotient of two other functions:
            <me>
                f(x) = \frac{u(x)}{v(x)}
            </me>.
            Our goal is that we want to find <m>f'(x)</m>, but we're going to shuffle this function around first. We won't calculate this derivative directly!
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Start with <m>f(x)=\dfrac{u(x)}{v(x)}</m>. Multiply <m>v(x)</m> on both sides to write a definition for <m>u(x)</m>.
                <me>
                    u(x) = <fillin characters="20" />
                </me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Find <m>u'(x)</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Wait: we don't care about <m>u'(x)</m>. Right? We care about finding <m>f'(x)</m>!
            </p>
            <p>
                Use what you found for <m>u'(x)</m> and solve for <m>f'(x)</m>.
                <me>
                    f'(x) = <fillin characters="20" />
                </me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                This is a strange formula: we have a formula for <m>f'(x)</m> written in terms of <m>f(x)</m>! But we said earlier that <m>f(x) = \dfrac{u(x)}{v(x)}</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In your formula for <m>f'(x)</m>, replace <m>f(x)</m> with <m>\dfrac{u(x)}{v(x)}</m>.
                <me>
                    f'(x) = <fillin characters="20" />
                </me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
