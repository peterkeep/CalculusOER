    <title>Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's try to think through the derivatives of <m>y=\sin(\theta)</m> and <m>y=\cos(\theta)</m>. In this activity, we'll look at graphs and try to collect some information about the derivative functions. We'll be practicing out interpretations, so if you need to brush up on <xref ref="sec-InterpretingDerivatives"/> before we start, that's fine!

               The following plot includes both the graph of <m>y=\sin(x)</m>, and the line tangent to <m>y=\sin(x)</m>. Watch as the point where we build the tangent line moves along the graph, between <m>x=-2\pi</m> and <m>x=2\pi</m>.

                Collect as much information about the derivative, <m>y'</m>, as you can. What do you know about it? What are some facts about the slopes of the tangent lines in this animation?

            <p>
                What kinds of values do the slopes take? Are there some values that these slopes will never be? Can you find any special points on this graph where you can actually tell what the slope is?

                We're going to get more specific here: let's find the coordinates of points that are on both the graph of <m>y=\sin(x)</m> and it's derivative <m>y'</m>. Remember, to get the values for <m>y'</m>, we're really looking at the slope of the tangent line at that point.

                Let's repeat this process using the <m>y=\cos(x)</m> function instead.
