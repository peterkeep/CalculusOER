    <title>Derivatives of Trigonometric Functions</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's try to think through the derivatives of <m>y=\sin(\theta)</m> and <m>y=\cos(\theta)</m>. In this activity, we'll look at graphs and try to collect some information about the derivative functions. We'll be practicing out interpretations, so if you need to brush up on <xref ref="sec-InterpretingDerivatives"/> before we start, that's fine!

               The following plot includes both the graph of <m>y=\sin(x)</m>, and the line tangent to <m>y=\sin(x)</m>. Watch as the point where we build the tangent line moves along the graph, between <m>x=-2\pi</m> and <m>x=2\pi</m>.

                Can you imagine a function that oscillates smoothly between <m>-1</m> and <m>1</m>, but seems phase shifted from the sine function? A function that, when we evaluate it at 0, returns 1 (compared to <m>\sin(0)=0</m>)?

                Be careful with your guess here: it's tempting to guess that <m>y'=\sin(x)</m>, but it might be helpful to plot the points from the sine function alongside these ones to notice how <m>y'</m> is similar but different than the sine function.
