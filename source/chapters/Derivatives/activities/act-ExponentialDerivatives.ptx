    <title>Derivative of the Exponential Function</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to consider a maybe-unfamiliar function, <m>f(x)=e^x</m>. We'll explore this function in a similar way to use thinking about the derivatives of sine and cosine in <xref ref="act-TrigDerivatives" text="type-global-text"/>: we'll look at a tangent line at different points, and think about the slope.

                The plot below includes both the graph of <m>y=e^x</m> and the line tangent to <m>y=e^x</m>. Watch as the point moves along the curve.

                Collect as much information about the derivative, <m>y'</m>, as you can. What do you know about it? What are some facts about the slopes of the tangent lines in this animation?

        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Are there any <m>x</m>-values where the slope is negative? Are there any where the slope is equal to 0? What happens to the slopes as <m>x</m> increases?

                There is a slightly hidden fact about slopes and tangent lines in this animation. In the following animation, we'll add (and label) one more point. Let's look at this again, this time noting the point at which this tangent line crosses the <m>x</m>-axis. This will make it easier to think about slopes!

                What information does this reveal about the slopes?

            <p>
                Especially it might be helpful to think about the slopes and their relationship to the <m>y</m>-value of the point we are building the tangent line at.

                Make a conjecture about the slope of the line tangent to the exponential function <m>y=e^x</m> at any <m>x</m>-value. What do you believe the formula/equation for <m>y'</m> is then?
