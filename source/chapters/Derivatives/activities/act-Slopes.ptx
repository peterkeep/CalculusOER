        <p>
        We're going to calculate and make some conjectures about slopes of lines between points, where the points are on the graph of a function. Let's define the following function:
        <me>
            f(x)=\frac{1}{x+2}
        </me>.

                We're going to calculate a lot of slopes! Calculate the slope of the line connecting each pair of points on the curve of <m>f(x)</m>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>(-1, f(-1))</m> and <m>(0,f(0))</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>(-0.5, f(-0.5))</m> and <m>(0,f(0))</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>(-0.1, f(-0.1))</m> and <m>(0,f(0))</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>(-0.001, f(-.001))</m> and <m>(0,f(0))</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                Let's calculate another group of slopes. Find the slope of the lines connecting these pairs of points:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>(0,f(0))</m> and <m>(1,f(1))</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>(0,f(0))</m> and <m>(0.5,f(0.5))</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>(0,f(0))</m> and <m>(0.1,f(0.1))</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <m>(0,f(0))</m> and <m>(0.001,f(0.001))</m>
                        </p>
                    </li>

                Now imagine a line that is tangent to the graph of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=0</m>. We are thinking of a line that touches the graph at <m>x=0</m>, but runs along side of the curve there instead of through it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make a conjecture about the slope of this line, using what we've seen above.

               Can you represent the slope you're thinking of above with a limit? What limit are we approximating in the slope calculations above? Set up the limit and evaluate it, confirming your conjecture.
