       <p>
            We'll start this off by thinking about slopes. Before we begin, you should be able to answer the following questions:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        What <em>is</em> a slope? How could you describe it?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How do you calculate the slope of a line between two points?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        If we have a function <m>f(x)</m> and we pick two points on the curve of the function, what does the slope of a straight line connecting the two points tell us? What kind of behavior about <m>f(x)</m> does this slope describe?
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
       </p>

        <title>Derivative at a Point</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    For a function <m>f(x)</m>, we say that the <term>derivative</term> of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=a</m> is:
                    <me>
                        f'(a) = \lim_{x\to a} \left(\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\right)
                    </me>
                    provided that the limit exists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If <m>f'(a)</m> exists, then we say <m>f(x)</m> is <term>differentiable</term> at <m>a</m>.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
            We can investigate this definition visually. Consider the function <m>f(x)</m> plotted below, where we will look at the point <m>(-1, f(-1))</m>. In the definition of the limit, we'll let <m>a=-1</m>, and so consider:
            <me>
                \lim_{x\to-1}\left(\dfrac{f(x)-f(-1)}{x-(-1)}\right)
            </me>.
            Can you estimate the limit of the slope of the tangent line as <m>x\to -1</m>?

        <p>
            Does it look like the limit of the slope between <m>(-1,f(-1))</m> and <m>(x,f(x))</m> exists as <m>x\to -1</m>? What do you think it is?

        <title>The Derivative Function</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    For a function <m>f(x)</m>, the derivative of <m>f(x)</m>, denoted <m>f'(x)</m>, is:
                    <me>
                        f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x\to 0} \left( \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x} \right)
                    </me>
                    for <m>x</m>-values in the domain of <m>f(x)</m> where this limit exists.
                </p>
            </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
            This definition feels pretty different, but we can hopefully notice that this is really just calculating a slope. Notice, in the following plot, that there is a significant difference. In the visualization of the <xref ref="def-DerivativeAtPoint" text="title"/>, the first point was fixed into place and the second point was the one that we moved and changed. It was the one with the variable <m>x</m>-value.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice in the following visualization that the <em>first</em> point is the one that is moveable while the <em>second</em> point is defined based on the first one (and the horizontal difference between the points, <m>\Delta x</m>). This means that we don't need to define one specific point, and can find the slope of the line tangent to <m>f(x)</m> at some changing <m>x</m>-value.
