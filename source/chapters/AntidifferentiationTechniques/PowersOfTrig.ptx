  <title>Integrating Powers of Trigonometric Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let's remind ourselves of two example problems that we've done in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="ex-uSubTurn"/>, we performed a <m>u</m>-substitution, but needed to work to re-write our whole integrand in terms of <m>u</m>. Specifically, we found that in the numerator, there was an <m>x^3</m>, but <m>du=2x\;dx</m>. We were substituting out a linear function of <m>x</m> in the numerator, but the actual function was cubic. This wasn't a problem: we re-wrote <m>x^3=x^2\cdot x</m>, and noticed that the extra <m>x^2</m> was able to be substituted, since we could re-write out subsitution rule: we noted that <m>u=x^2+1</m> is equivalent to <m>x^2=u-1</m>. This meant that even though we had an extra factor of <m>x^2</m> "in" the part that we were using for substituting in the differential <m>du</m>, we were still able to translate the whole function to be written in terms of <m>u</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, more recently, in <xref ref="ex-sincos"/>, we noted that we could use a mix of methods to integrate this:
    </p>
    <p>
      One on hand, we can look at the structure of the integrand and notice that we have a product of two functions! Integration by parts was a fine strategy to employ, and that's what we did in the example. On the other hand, we noticed that since we have this function-derivative pairing, a <m>u</m>-substitution was also appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we'll explore more combinations of trigonometric functions and build a strategy for antidifferentiating them that includes some ideas from both of these previous examples.

          For integrals in the form <m>\int \sin^p(x)\cos^q(x)\;dx</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are real number exponents:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>q</m>, the exponent on <m>\cos(x)</m> is odd, we should use <m>u=\sin(x)</m> and <m>du=\cos(x)\;dx</m>. Then we can apply the Pythagorean Identity <m>\cos^2(x)=1-\sin^2(x)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>p</m>, the exponent on <m>\sin(x)</m> is odd, we should use <m>u=\cos(x)</m> and <m>du=-\sin(x)\;dx</m>. Then we can apply the Pythagorean Identity <m>\sin^2(x)=1-\cos^2(x)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are even, we can either use <xref ref="thm-IntegrationByParts" text="title"/> or use the following power-reducing trigonometric identities:
                <md>
                  <mrow> \sin^2(x) \amp=\dfrac{1-\cos(2x)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}-\frac{\cos(2x)}{2} </mrow>
                  <mrow> \cos^2(x) \amp=\dfrac{1+\cos(2x)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{\cos(2x)}{2} </mrow>
                </md>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </algorithm>
    <p>
      A strange note, here, is that we typically pick our <m>u</m>-substitution based on looking to see a suitable candidate for <m>u</m>: we look for functions that are composed "inside" of other functions or we look for a function whose derivative is in the integral (the "function-derivative pair" that we talk about in <xref ref="sec-uSubstitution"/>). Here, though, we're selecting our substitution based on <m>du</m>: we're looking to see which function we can set aside one copy of for the differential, and then have an even power left over so that we can apply the Pythagorean Identity to translate the rest.
