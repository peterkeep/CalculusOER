  <title>Integrating Powers of Trigonometric Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let's remind ourselves of two example problems that we've done in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="ex-uSubTurn"/>, we performed a <m>u</m>-substitution, but needed to work to rewrite our whole integrand in terms of <m>u</m>. Specifically, we found that in the numerator, there was an <m>x^3</m>, but <m>du=2x\;dx</m>. We were substituting out a linear function of <m>x</m> in the numerator, but the actual function was cubic. This wasn't a problem: we rewrote <m>x^3=x^2\cdot x</m>, and noticed that the extra <m>x^2</m> was able to be substituted, since we could rewrite our substitution rule: we noted that <m>u=x^2+1</m> is equivalent to <m>x^2=u-1</m>. This meant that even though we had an extra factor of <m>x^2</m> <q>in</q> the part that we were using for substituting in the differential <m>du</m>, we were still able to translate the whole function to be written in terms of <m>u</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, more recently, in <xref ref="ex-sincos"/>, we noted that we could use a mix of methods to integrate this:
      <me>
        \int \sin(x)\cos(x)\;dx
      </me>.      
    </p>
    <p>
      On one hand, we can look at the structure of the integrand and notice that we have a product of two functions! Integration by parts was a fine strategy to employ, and that's what we did in the example. On the other hand, we noticed that since we have this function-derivative pairing, a <m>u</m>-substitution also was appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we'll explore more combinations of trigonometric functions and build a strategy for antidifferentiating them that includes some ideas from both of these previous examples.
    </p>

          For integrals in the form<m>\displaystyle\int\sin^p(x)\cos^q(x)\;dx</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are real number exponents:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>q</m>, the exponent on <m>\cos(x)</m> is odd, we should use <m>u=\sin(x)</m> and <m>du=\cos(x)\;dx</m>. Then, we can apply the Pythagorean Identity <m>\cos^2(x)=1-\sin^2(x)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>p</m>, the exponent on <m>\sin(x)</m> is odd, we should use <m>u=\cos(x)</m> and <m>du=-\sin(x)\;dx</m>. Then, we can apply the Pythagorean Identity <m>\sin^2(x)=1-\cos^2(x)</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If both <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are even, we can either use <xref ref="strat-IntegrationByParts" text="title"/> or use the following power-reducing trigonometric identities:
                <md>
                  <mrow> \sin^2(x) \amp=\dfrac{1-\cos(2x)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}-\frac{\cos(2x)}{2} </mrow>
                  <mrow> \cos^2(x) \amp=\dfrac{1+\cos(2x)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{\cos(2x)}{2} </mrow>
                </md>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </assemblage>
    <p>
      A strange note, here, is that we typically pick our <m>u</m>-substitution based on looking to see a suitable candidate for <m>u</m>: we look for functions that are composed <q>inside</q> of other functions or we look for a function whose derivative is in the integral (the <q>function-derivative pair</q> that we talk about in <xref ref="sec-uSubstitution"/>). Here, though, we're selecting our substitution based on <m>du</m>: we're looking to see which function we can set aside one copy of for the differential, and then have an even power left over so that we can apply the Pythagorean Identity to translate the rest.

          For each of the following, identify an appropriate substitution, make a note of which trigonometric identity you'll use, and then integrate.

            Notice that the exponent on <m>\sin(x)</m> is odd: if you let <m>u=\cos(x)</m>, you'll end up with <m>\sin^4(x)</m> left over in your integral, and you can write it as <m>(\underbrace{1-\cos^2(x)}_{\sin^2(x)})^2</m>.

            This one seems scary at first, because of the fraction exponent. Notice, though, that you have <em>no hope</em> of converting fractional exponents of sine functions into cosine functions easily. So, pick <m>u=\sin(x)</m> and try to convert any remaining cosines using <m>\cos^2(x)=1-\sin^2(x)</m>.

            You get a choice here! Both exponents are odd, so picking either function as <m>u</m> will leave you with an even exponent on the other function on which to use the Pythagorean Identity. Is there a choice of <m>u</m> that will be easier than the other choice?

            You have some choices here! If you use <m>u=\sec(x)</m>, then you'll end up with a remaining <m>tan^2(x)</m> to convert using a Pythagorean Identity. Alternatively, if you use <m>u=\tan(x)</m>, you'll end up needing to convert the remaining <m>\sec^6(x) = (\sec^2(x))^3</m>.

            Another fraction exponent that is pushing us towards using <m>u=\tan(x)</m>. There will still be a <m>\sec^4(x)</m> to convert after substituting in <m>du</m>.

            The odd exponent on tangent is fine, since we can use <m>u=\sec(x)</m> to leave us with a <m>\tan^4(x)</m> to convert.
