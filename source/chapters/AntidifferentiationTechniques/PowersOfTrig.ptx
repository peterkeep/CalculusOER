  <title>Integrating Powers of Trigonometric Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let's remind ourselves of two example problems that we've done in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="ex-uSubTurn"/>, we performed a <m>u</m>-substitution, but needed to work to re-write our whole integrand in terms of <m>u</m>. Specifically, we found that in the numerator, there was an <m>x^3</m>, but <m>du=2x\;dx</m>. We were substituting out a linear function of <m>x</m> in the numerator, but the actual function was cubic. This wasn't a problem: we re-wrote <m>x^3=x^2\cdot x</m>, and noticed that the extra <m>x^2</m> was able to be substituted, since we could re-write out subsitution rule: we noted that <m>u=x^2+1</m> is equivalent to <m>x^2=u-1</m>. This meant that even though we had an extra factor of <m>x^2</m> "in" the part that we were using for substituting in the differential <m>du</m>, we were still able to translate the whole function to be written in terms of <m>u</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, more recently, in <xref ref="ex-sincos"/>, we noted that we could use a mix of methods to integrate this:
    </p>
    <p>
      One on hand, we can look at the structure of the integrand and notice that we have a product of two functions! Integration by parts was a fine strategy to employ, and that's what we did in the example. On the other hand, we noticed that since we have this function-derivative pairing, a <m>u</m>-substitution was also appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we'll explore more combinations of trigonometric functions and build a strategy for antidifferentiating them that includes some ideas from both of these previous examples.
