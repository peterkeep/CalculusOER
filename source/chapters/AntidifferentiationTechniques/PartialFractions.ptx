  <title>Partial Fractions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this last integration technique, we'll consider more rational functions. We've already thought about rational functions a bit (<xref ref="strat-RationalFunctions" text="title"/>), but here we'll add some more detail to a special type of rational function. Let's not spoil anything. Instead, we'll just jump into a quick comparison.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-PartialFractionCompare.ptx" />
    <p>
      We're going to try to take advantage of the re-written structure in <xref ref="act-PartialFractionCompare"/>: when we can decompose a "large" rational function into a sum of "smaller" rational functions, we'll be more likely to be able to antidifferentiate the "smaller" pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real trick, here, is going to be recognizing <em>when</em> we can do this and building a process for <em>how</em> we do this.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec-WhenPartialFractions">
    <title>When?</title>
    <p>
      In order to recognize <em>when</em> we will employ this strategy, we should think about what we're doing: We are attempting to write one fraction as a sum or difference of others. We're "undo-ing" fraction addition, here. We can remember that when we add (or subtract) fractions, we need to find a common denominator and re-write our fraction terms as equivalent versions with this same denominator. This is typically done by just "scaling" the numerator and denominator of a fraction by a factor (often then other denominator). For instance:
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{3}{5} - \frac{1}{3} \amp  = \frac{3}{5}\left(\frac{3}{3}\right) - \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{5}{5}\right)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \frac{9}{15} - \frac{5}{15}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \frac{4}{15}</mrow>
      </md>
      This same thing happens when we think about rational functions:
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x-1} \amp = \frac{1}{x}\left(\frac{x-1}{x-1}\right) + \frac{2}{x-1}\left(\frac{x}{x}\right)</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp = \frac{x-1}{x(x-1)} + \frac{2x}{x(x-1)}</mrow>
        <mrow> \amp =\frac{3x-1}{x(x-1)}\;\;\text{ or } \;\;\frac{3x-1}{x^2-x}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we can notice something about these (common) denominators: since we scaled each fraction before adding/subtracting them, the denominator is a product of factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      So right away we know that this method will only work well when we can factor the denominator of a rational integrand. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We also know (from <xref ref="strat-RationalFunctions" text="title"/>) that once the degree of the numerator is at least the same (or larger) than the degree of the denominator, we can re-write things using division.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we will use this strategy of re-writing rational function integrands as sums or differences of "smaller" rational functions when:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The denominator can be factored.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The degree of the denominator is larger than the degree of the numerator.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection xml:id="subsec-HowPartialFractions">
    <title>How?</title>
    <p>
      The actual process for finding the smaller "partial" fractions is not complicated. Once we have the denominator of our rational function factored, we can see what the possible denominators that had to "combine" to make a "common" denominator were. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our general process will be simple: set up these possible rational functions and put unknown placeholder numerators in place, making sure that the degree is smaller than the degree of the denominator. Then, we add these possible rational functions up and compare the numerator (with the unknown placeholders) to the numerator that we want (from our actual function that we're integrating).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are more tricks along the way, but this process is simple to think about. What we'll find, though, is that the process is full of algebra, which can be tedious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at two small examples to see how this could work.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-PartialFractionFirstExamples.ptx" />
    <p>
      So we can see the basics of how this will work: 
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Figure out the denominators of the fractions we could add to get the function we're integrating.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Construct the partial fractions using placeholders for the numerators (making sure to keep the degree of the numerators smaller than the degree of the denominators).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add these placeholder fractions up, and see what the coefficients would have to be in order to make them add to the function we're integrating.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Antidifferentiate the smaller rational functions.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-SpecificStrategies">
    <title>More Specific Strategies</title>
    <p>
      We're going to investigate these partial fractions a bit more, and focus on two cases: linear denominators, and quadratic denominators. This will limit the scope of our work enough that this doesn't get too wild, and also works well with the kinds of things we know how to antidifferentiate: we can antidifferentiate any rational function with a linear denominator and we know how to antidifferentiate many rational functions with quadratic denominators.
    </p>
    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-SimpleLinear">
      <title>Partial Fraction Type: Simple Linear Factors</title>
      <p>
        For rational functions where the denominator has some linear factor like <m>(x-k)</m>, we can set up a partial fraction with just a constant coefficient in the numerator:
        <me>
          \frac{A}{x-k}
        </me>.
        We have outlined a pretty reasonable approach for these in <xref ref="act-PartialFractionsFirstExamples"/> when we worked on the integral
        <me>
          \int \frac{6x-16}{(x-3)(x-1)\;dx
        </me>.
        We can make note of something useful, though. At one point during the process, we had set up the two partial fractions, added them together, and then we said that we wanted to find the values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> that made the general partial fraction forms we had set up match with the actual function we were hoping to integrate.
        <md>
          <mrow>\frac{A}{x-3} + \frac{B}{x-1} \amp = \frac{A(x-1) + B(x-3)}{(x-3)(x-1)</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \frac{6x-16}{(x-3)(x-1)}</mrow>
        </md>
        What this meant for us was that we can set the numerators equal to each other and solve for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>:
        <me>
          A(x-1)+B(x-3)=6x-16
        </me>.
        Let's pause here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are hoping to find the values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> that will make this equation work out for all values of <m>x</m>. But we can also make use of the fact that this equation will be true for some <em>specific</em> values of <m>x</m>. For instance, we can evaluate this equation at <m>x=2</m>:
        <md>
          <mrow>A(2-1)+B(2-3) \amp = 6(2)-16</mrow>
          <mrow>A-B \amp = -4 </mrow>
        </md>
        This just generates another equation connecting <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> that we could use like we did in in <xref ref="act-PartialFractionsFirstExamples"/>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But is there a nicer, more convenient <m>x</m>-value to use? Can we force this to generate a nicer equation involving our unknown coefficients?
      </p>
