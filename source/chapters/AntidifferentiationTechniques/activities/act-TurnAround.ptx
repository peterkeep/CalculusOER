    <title>Turn Around Problems</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            The two integrals that we're going to look at are "just" some <m>u</m>-substitution problems, but I like to call integrals like these <term>turn-around</term> problems. We'll see why!

        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider the integral:
                <me>
                    \int x\sqrt[3]{x+5}\;dx
                </me>.
                First, explain why <m>u</m>-substitution is reasonable here.

                Do you see composition? A function inside of something?
