    <title>Compare and Contrast</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's do a quick comparison of two integrals, keeping the above examples in mind. Consider these two integrals:
            <md>
                <mrow>\int \sin^4(x)\cos(x)\;dx \amp \amp\text{compared with} \amp \amp \int \sin^4(x)\cos^3(x)\;dx</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Consider the first integral, <m>\int \sin^4(x)\cos(x)\;dx</m>. Think about and set up a good technique for antidifferentiating. Without actually solving the integral, explain why this technique will work.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                It might be helpful to notice that <m>\sin^4(x)</m> can be re-written as <m>\left(\sin(x)\right)^4</m>. Does this help reveal something important about the structure of this integrand?

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Now consider the second integral, <m>\int \sin^4(x)\cos^3(x)\;dx</m>. Does the same integration strategy work here? What happens when you apply the same thing?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Let <m>u=\sin(x)</m> again, and <m>du=\cos(x)\;dx</m>. What happens with the cosine functions? How many are "left" after applying our substitution?
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                We know that <m>\sin(x)</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m> are related to each other through derivatives (each is the derivative of the other, up to a negative). Is there some other connection that we have between these functions? We might especially notice that we have a <m>\cos^2(x)</m> left over in our integral. Can we write this in terms of <m>\sin(x)</m>, so that we can write it in terms of <m>u</m>?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                We have a trigonometric identity (the Pythagorean Identity):
                <me>
                    \sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x) = 1
                </me>.
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Why would this strategy not have worked if we were looking at the integrals <m>\int\sin^4(x)\cos^2(x)\;dx</m> or <m>\int \sin^4(x)\cos^4(x)\;dx</m>? What, specifically, did we need in order to use this combination of substitution and trigonometric identity to solve the integral?
