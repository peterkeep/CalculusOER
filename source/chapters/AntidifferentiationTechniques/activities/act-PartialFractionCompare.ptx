    <title>Comparing Rational Integrands</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to compare three integrals:
            <me>
                \int \frac{2}{x^2+4x+5}\;dx
            </me>
            
            <me>
                \int \frac{2}{x^2+4x+3}\;dx
            </me>
            <me>
                \int \left(\frac{1}{x+1} - \frac{1}{x+3}\right)\;dx
            </me>
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Start with the first integral: 
                <me>
                     \int \frac{2}{x^2+4x+5}\;dx
                </me>.
                How would you approach integrating this?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
               This is a constant over a quadratic: can you complete the square, and then connect the result to an inverse tangent function?
            </p>
        </hint>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Try the same tactic on the second integral:
                <me>
                    \int \frac{2}{x^2+4x+3}\;dx
                </me>.
                You don't need to complete this integral, but think about how you might proceed.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Check the structure of the denominator when you complete the square: since you don't end up with a sum of squares, you can't use the inverse tangent setup. You'll need to do a trig substitution instead...
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Think about the third integral:
                <me>
                    \int \left(\frac{1}{x+1} - \frac{1}{x+3}\right)\;dx
                </me>.
                How would you integrate this?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                The third integral is unique from the other two in that is has two terms. Let's combine them together to see how we could write this integral to compare it more closely to the other two.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subtract <m>\dfrac{1}{x+1}-\dfrac{1}{x+3}</m> using common denominators and compare your re-written integral to the other two.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>

                Which of these integrals and/or representations of an integral is easiest to work with? Which one is most annoying to work with? Why?
