<title>Remembering the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        We want to think about generalizing our notion of integrals a bit. So in this activity, section, we're going to think about some of the requirements for the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and try to loosen them up a bit to see what happens. We'll try to construct meaningful approaches to these situations that fit our overall goals of calculating area under a curve.

        This practice, in general, is a really good and common mathematical process: taking some result and playing with the requirements or assumptions to see what else can happen. So it might feel like we're just fiddling with the "What if?" questions, but what we're actually doing is good mathematics!

            What does the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus say about evaluating the definite integral <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=a}^{x=b} f(x)\, dx</m>?

    <statement>
        <p>
            What do we need to be true about our setup, our function, etc. for us to be able to apply this technique to evaluate <m>\displaystyle \int_{x=a}^{x=b} f(x)\,dx</m>?

<conclusion>
    <p>
        We are going to introduce the idea of "Improper Integrals" as kind-of-but-not-quite definite integrals that we can evaluate. They are going to violate the requirements for the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, but we'll work to salvage them in meaningful ways.
