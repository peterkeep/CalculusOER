            Let's say that we want to find what the <m>y</m>-values of some function <m>f(x)</m> are when the <m>x</m>-values are <q>infinitely close to</q> some value, <m>x=a</m>. Since there is no single <m>x</m>-value that is <q>infinitely close to</q> <m>a</m> that we can evaluate <m>f(x)</m> at, we need to do something else. How do we do this?

            Let's say that we want to find the rate of change of some function instantaneously at a point with <m>x=a</m>. We can't find a rate of change unless we have two points, since we need to find some differences in the outputs and inputs. How do we do this?

            Suppose you want to find the total area, covered by an infinite number of infinitely thin rectangles. You have a formula for finding the dimensions and areas for some finite number of rectangles, but how do we get an infinite number of them?
