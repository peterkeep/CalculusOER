    <title>Discovering the Integration by Parts Formula</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            The product rule for derivatives says that:
            <me>
                \ddx{u(x)\cdot v(x)} = <fillin characters="5" /> + <fillin characters="5" />
            </me>.
            We know that we intend to <q>undo</q> the product rule, so let's try to reframe the product rule from a rule about derivatives to a rule about antiderivatives.

                Antidifferentiate the product rule by antidifferentiating each side of the equation.
                <me>
                    \begin{aligned}
                        \int \left(\ddx{u\cdot v}\right)\;dx \amp= \int <fillin characters="5" />+ <fillin characters="5" /> dx\\
                        <fillin characters="5" /> \amp= \int <fillin characters="5" /> dx + \int <fillin characters="5" /> dx
                    \end{aligned}
                </me>
            </p>
        </statement>

            <p>
                Note that on the left side of this equation, you're antidifferentiating a derivative. What will that give you? Then, on the right side, we're just splitting up the terms of the product rule into two different integrals.

            <p>
                On the right side, we have two integrals. Since each of them has a product of functions (one function and a derivative of another), we can isolate one of them in this equation and create a formula for how to antidifferentiate a product of functions!

                Solve for <m>\int u v'\;dx</m>.

                Look back at this formula for <m>\int u v'\;dx</m>. Explain how this is really the product rule for derivatives (without just undoing all of the steps we have just done).
