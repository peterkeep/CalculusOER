        <p>
            We're going to consider three triangles, and we're going to fill in side lengths. In each of these, we'll assume that the lengths <m>x</m> and <m>a</m> are real numbers and are positive.

                Use the Pythagorean theorem to label the missing side length in each of the three triangles.

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                For each triangle, explain how you can tell which side length represents the hypotenuse when you see the lengths <m>x</m>, <m>a</m>, and then the missing lengths you found above: <m>\sqrt{x^2-a^2}</m>, <m>\sqrt{a^2-x^2}</m>, or <m>\sqrt{x^2+a^2}</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                We know that the hypotenuse is the longest side length in a triangle. Just based on the square root length, how can you tell which length is longest?
            </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
            <p>
                If one of the side lengths is <m>\sqrt{x^2-a^2}</m>, then we know that <m>x\gt a</m> (otherwise the square root is a non-real number). We also know that <m>x\gt \sqrt{x^2-a^2}</m> (because <m>a\gt 0</m>). This means that <m>x</m> is the length of the hypotenuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                If one of the side lengths is <m>\sqrt{a^2-x^2}</m>, then we know that <m>a\gt x</m> (otherwise the square root is a non-real number). We also know that <m>a\gt \sqrt{a^2-x^2}</m> (because <m>x\gt 0</m>). This means that <m>a</m> is the length of the hypotenuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                If one of the side lengths is <m>\sqrt{x^2+a^2}</m>, then we know that <m>\sqrt{x^2+a^2} \gt a</m> and <m>\sqrt{x^2+a^2} \gt x</m> (because <m>x,a\gt 0</m>). This means that <m>\sqrt{x^2+a^2}</m> is the length of the hypotenuse.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                For each triangle, find a trigonometric function of <m>\theta</m> that connects lengths <m>x</m> and <m>a</m> to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                Solve each for <m>x</m> to reveal the relevant substitution.
            </p>

    <task>

            <p>
                For each substitution, find the corresponding substitution for the differential, <m>dx</m>.
