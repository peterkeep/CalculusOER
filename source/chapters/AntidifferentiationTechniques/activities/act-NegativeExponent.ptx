    <title>A Negative Exponent</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Let's think about this integral:
                <me>
                    \int \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\;dx
                </me>.
        </p>
    </introduction>
        <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Is there any composition in this integral? Pick it out, and either explain or show that using this to guide your substitution will not be helpful.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Notice that <m>-x</m> is composed inside of the exponential function. Try a substitution with <m>u=-x</m>.
            </p>

    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What does <m>e^{-x}</m> mean? What does <m>\frac{1}{e^{-x}}</m> mean?
            </p>
        </statement>

                Re-write the integral, specifically focusing on the negative exponent. You should find that the function looks worse! How can you clean that up?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Re-write <m>e^{-x}</m> as <m>\frac{1}{e^x}</m>, giving you:
                <me>
                    \int \fra{1}{1+\frac{1}{e^x}}\;dx
                </me>.
            </p>
        </hint>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Either add the fractions in the denominator or multiply the whole fraction by <m>\frac{e^x}{e^x}</m>.
            </p>
        </hint>
        <solution>
            <p>
                You should have an integral that looks like:
                <me>\int \frac{e^x}{e^x+1}\;dx</me>.
            </p>
        </solution>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Why is this new integral set up so much better for the purpose of <m>u</m>-substitution? How could we tell this just by looking at the initial integral?
