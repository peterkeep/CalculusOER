    <title>Picking the Parts for Integration by Parts</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            This time we'll look at a very similar integral:
            <me>
                \int x\ln(x)\;dx
            </me>.
            Again, we'll set this up two different ways and compsare them.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                We'll start with selecting <m>u=x</m> and <m>dv = \ln(x)\;dx</m>. Fill in the following with the rest of the pieces:
                <me>
                    \begin{array}{ll}
                        u = x \amp v = \blank{3cm}\\
                        du = \blank{3cm} \amp dv = \ln(x)\;dx
                    \end{array}
                </me>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                You're not forgetting how to antidifferentiate <m>\ln(x)</m>. This is just something we don't know yet!
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Ok, so here we <em>have to</em> swap the pieces and try the setup with <m>u=\ln(x)</m> and <m>dv = x\;dx</m>, since we only know how to differentiate <m>\ln(x)</m>. Fill in the following with the rest of the pieces:
                <me>
                    \begin{array}{ll}
                        u = \ln(x) \amp v = \blank{3cm}\\
                        du = \blank{3cm} \amp dv = x\;dx
                    \end{array}
                </me>
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Now set up the integration by parts formula using this setup.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                <m>\int u\;dv = uv - \int v\;du</m>
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Why was it fine for us to antidifferentiate <m>x</m> in this example, but not in <xref ref="act-PickingParts-1"/>?
            </p>
        </statement>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Finish this work to find <m>\int x\ln(x)\;dx</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
            <p>
                Notice that <m>\left(\frac{x^2}{2}\right)\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{x}{2}</m>.
            </p>
        </hint>
    </task>
    <conclusion>
        <p>
            So here, we didn't actually get much choice. We couldn't pick <m>u=x</m> in order to differentiate it (and get a constant to multiply into our second integral) since we don't know how to antidifferentiate <m>\ln(x)</m> (yet: once we know how, it might be fun to come back to this problem and try it again with the parts flipped).

            But we can also notice that it ended up being fine to antidifferentiate <m>x</m>: the increased power from our power rule didn't really matter much when we combined it with the derivative of the logarithm, since the derivative of the log is <em>also a power function</em>! So we were able to combine those easily and actually integrate that second integral.
