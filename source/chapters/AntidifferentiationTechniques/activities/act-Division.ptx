    <title>Integrating a Rational Function Three Ways</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to think about the integral:
            <me>
                \int \left( \frac{x^2+3x-1}{x-1}\right)\;dx
            </me>.
            Let's find 3 different ways of integrating this. This is kind of misleading, since we're actually going to look at 2, since we've already used <m>u</m>-substitution to integrate this in <xref ref="ex-TurnAround"/>.
        </p>
    </introduction>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Let's just notice some things about this rational function. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Are there any vertical asymptotes? How do you know where to find them?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Are there any horizontal asymptotes? How do you know that there <em>aren't</em>?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            When you zoom really far out on the graph of this function, it looks like a different kind of function. What kind of function? Why is that?
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            There's a vertical asymptote at <m>x=1</m>, since that's where we'd find a limit with the form <m>\frac{\#}{0}</m>, like in <xref ref="subsec-InfiniteLimits" text="type-global-title"/>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            There aren't any horizontal asymptotes! We know that because the degree is larger in the numerator, like in <xref ref="subsec-EndBehaviorLimits" text="type-global-title"/>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            This graph looks linear:
                        </p>
                        <interactive desmos="y94v249fss" width="60%" aspect="2:3" />
                        <p>
                            This is because the numerator is one degree larger than the denominator. When we divide these two functions, we expect to end up with some sort of linear function and a remainder that approachs 0 as <m>x\to\pm\infty</m>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </solution>
    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                Now we're going to re-write the function itself: <m>\dfrac{x^2+3x-1}{x-1}</m> means we're dividing <m>(x^2+3x-1)</m> by <m>(x-1)</m>. So let's do the division!

                Re-write your integral using this new version of the function. Notice that we haven't done any calculus or antidifferentiating yet. Explain why this new version of this integrand function is easier to antidifferentiate. What do you get?

                Let's approach this integral differently. We said earlier that this function is really an "almost" linear function in disguise: when we divide the quadratic numerator by a linear denominator, we expect a linear function to be left over. In the long division, we saw this happen! We ended with a linear function and some remainder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's try to uncover this linear function. If we're looking to find what linear functions multiply together to get <m>(x^2+3x-1)</m>, then we can try factoring!
                <me>
                    \frac{x^2+3x-1}{x-1}=\frac{(<fillin characters="5" />)(<fillin characters="5" />)}{x-1}
                </me>
                In order for this factoring to be useful, we want to be able to "cancel" out the <m>x-1</m> factor in the denominator. We're really only interested in what linear factor will multiply by <m>(x-1)</m> to get <m>(x^2+3x-1)</m>.
                <me>
                    \frac{x^2+3x-1}{x-1}=\frac{(x-1)(<fillin characters="5" />)}{x-1}
                </me>
            </p>
            <p>
                First, explain why there is no linear function factor that accomplishes this.
            </p>

    </task>
    <task>
        <statement>
            <p>
                What if were able to "almost" factor this?
            </p>
            <p>
                If there <em>was</em> a linear factor that multiplied by <m>(x-1)</m> to get <m>(x^2+3x-1)</m>, then the linear portions would multiply together to get <m>x^2</m>. What does this mean about the first linear term of our factor?
            </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
                We need <m>(x-1)(x+<fillin characters="2" />)=(x^2+3x-1)</m> since <m>x(x)=x^2</m>.

        <statement>
            <p>
                What does the constant term of our missing factor need to be? We are hoping that whatever it is can multiply by <m>x</m> (from <m>x-1</m>) and combine with the <m>-x</m> (from the constant <m>-1</m> multiplied by <m>x</m> in our missing factor) to match the <m>3x</m> in <m>x^2+3x-1</m>.

                What is it?

        <solution>
            <p>
                We need to find <m>a</m> where when we multiply <m>(x-1)(x+a)</m> we end up with <m>ax-x=3x</m>. It should be clear that <m>a=4</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our missing factor is <m>(x-4)</m>.

                Note that we have <em>not</em> factored <m>(x^2+3x-1)</m>! We <em>almost</em> did: we found two factors: 
                <me>(x-1)(<fillin characters="5" />) = x^2+3x+<fillin characters="2" /></me>.
            </p>
            <p>
                How far off is the actual polynomial that we are working with, <m>x^2+3x-1</m>?
            </p>
            <p>
                Write <m>x^2+3x-1</m> as your two factors plus or minus some remainder.

                Find the constant term where:

                    x^2+3x-1=(x-1)(x+4)+<fillin characters="2" />

            <p>
                Since <m>(x-1)(x+4)=x^2+3x-4</m>, we need to add <m>3</m> to get <m>x^2+3x-1</m>.
                <me>
                    x^2+3x-1 = \overbrace{(x-1)(x+4)}^{x^2+3x-4}+3

                You should get the same thing that we got from using long division! Great! The rest of the integral will work the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we end, though, compare this antiderivative to the one we got in <xref ref="ex-TurnAround"/>. It's different. Why? Is this a problem?

        <hint>
            <p>
                It's only off by a constant! Show this by expanding all of the multiplication in
                <me>
                    \frac{(x-1)^2}{2}+5(x-1)+3\ln|x-1|
