  <title>Manipulating Integrands</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We've looked at how to use a variable substitution to antidifferentiate composite functions. We've already seen, though, that sometimes identifying and actually using a helpful substitution can be difficult to do. In this section, we want to introduce some different strategies for noticing and setting up useful substitutions in some specific instances. 
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-Rewriting">
    <title>Rewriting the Integrand</title>
    <p>
      We're going to look at a few different examples or strategies that revolve around the same idea: we're going to reveal a reasonable function to antidifferentiate, whether its through finding a substitution or putting our function into some other recognizeable form.
    </p>
    <example>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          For each of the following integrals, re-write the integrand function using some algebraic manipulation, trigonometric identity, or some other strategy. Then, once the integrand function is in a friendlier form, antidifferentiate.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <m>\displaystyle \int \tan^2(\theta)\;d\theta</m>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Can you think of a trigonometric identity that can help translate the squared tangent function into some other squared trigonometric function that we recognize as the derivative of something?
          </p>
        </hint>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <m>\displaystyle\int \left(\frac{x^2-9}{x+3}\right)\;dx</m>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Try some factoring! Can you factor and cancel?
          </p>
        </hint>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <m>\displaystyle\int\left(\frac{\sqrt{x}-4}{x^2}\right)\;dx</m>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Split this fraction into <m>\displaystyle\int \left(\frac{\sqrt{x}{x^2}} - \frac{4}{x^2}\right)\;dx</m>. Then, can you write these two terms as power functions?
          </p>
        </hint>
      </task>
    </example>
    <p>
      Let's look at one more type of example, just to re-iterate what we're thinking about with these re-written functions.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-NegativeExponent.ptx" />
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Re-write the integrand function for <m>\displaystyle \int \frac{1}{x+x^{-1}}\;dx</m>, and then integrate using an appropriate substitution.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Try to re-write this integral by noticing that <m>x^{-1}=\dfrac{1}{x}</m>. Then try to make the resulting fraction a bit nicer to look at, since it has a fraction inside of the denominator of another fraction.
        </p>
      </hint>

          <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{1}{x+x^{-1}}\;dx \amp = \int \frac{1}{x+\frac{1}{x}}\cdot\frac{x}{x}\;dx</mrow>

            <mrow>\int \frac{x}{x^2+1}\;dx \amp= \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{2x}{x^2+1}\;dx </mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{1}{u}\;du</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =\frac{1}{2}\ln|u|+C</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp \frac{1}{2}\ln(x^2+1)+C</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      This last example is a good one to help us transition into thinking about a whole class of functions: rational functions! As a reminder, these are just polynomials divided by polynomials.

    <title>Antidifferentiating Rational Functions</title>
    <p>
      Strategies for antidifferentiating rational functions are just that: strategies. There isn't one consistent rule to use to antidifferentiate these (like there is with derivatives and the Quotient Rule), but we'll find some common tactics to apply and try to build our intuition for noticing the different kinds of structure we can have in these rational functions. All of these strategies are based around cleverly re-writing our rational functions (using some algebraic manipulations) to reveal some structure. We'll try to notice the structure, so that we know what we're trying to reveal.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-Division.ptx" />
    <p>
      This gives us a good approach for whenever division will help us rewrite our rational function as some polynomial and a remainder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at two more rational functions: these ones won't be good candidates to use long division, but we'll try to build some intuition for why we will need to re-write one of them to get a substitution that works.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-LogVsInvTan.ptx" />
    <p>
      Going forward, when you see a quadratic denominator in a rational function, what are some things you can think about and strategies you can use, based on what the rest of the function looks like? We want to summarize this a bit!
    </p>
    <assemblage xml:id="strat-RationalFunctions">
      <title>Integrating Rational Functions</title>
      <p>
        If <m>f(x)=\dfrac{p_n(x)}{p_m(x)}</m> where <m>p_n(x)</m> is a degree <m>n</m> polynomial and <m>p_m(x)</m> is a degree <m>m</m> polynomial, then we can think about how we might integrate <m>\displaystyle \int f(x)\;dx</m> based on degrees.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>n\geq m</m> (the degree in the numerator is at least the degree in the denominator), then we can use long division to write <m>f(x)</m> as some polynomial with degree <m>n-m</m> and some remainder.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>n=m-1</m> (the degree of the numerator is one less than the degree of the denominator), then we can try a <m>u</m>-substitution where <m>u=p_m(x)</m>, since the derivative of <m>p_m(x)</m> is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m>. If this substitution works, we can antidifferentiate to get some sort of logarithm.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not guaranteed to work, but for now (without other strategies), this is something we can think about.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If we can reduce <m>f(x)</m> (through some transformation or substitution) to a rational function that is a constant term divided by quadratic function (or if it already is), then we can complete the square in the denominator to get to a form that can be antidifferentiated to an inverse tangent function.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </assemblage>
    <p>
      In the last point, we are referencing the strategy we found in <xref ref="act-LogVsInvTan"/>. We have a bit more of a general version of this strategy.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-GeneralizedInvTan">
      <title>Generalized Inverse Tangent Forms</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <me>
            \int \frac{1}{u^2+a^2}\;du = \frac{1}{a}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{u}{a}\right)+C
          </me>
        </p>
      </statement>
      <proof>
        <p>
          This is really just based on a clever substitution. Once we see this specific constant over a sum of squares, we can factor out a convenient coefficient to force the denominator to look like a sum of something squared and 1.
          <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{1}{u^2+a^2}\;du \amp= \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{\frac{u^2}{a^2}+1} \;du</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{\left(\frac{u}{a}\right)^2+1}\;du</mrow>
          </md>
          Now we can let <m>w=\frac{u}{a}</m> and <m>dw=\frac{1}{a}\;du</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow> \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{\left(\frac{u}{a}\right)^2+1}\;du \amp = \frac{1}{a}\int \frac{1}{\left(\frac{u}{a}\right)^2+1}\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)\;du</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp =\frac{1}{a}\int \frac{1}{w^2+1}\;dw</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{a}\tan^{-1}(w)+C</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{a}\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{u}{a}\right)+C</mrow>
          </md>
          This strategy can also be used for other inverse trigonometric derivatives. But we will use the inverse tangent form most of all, and thus we want to outline it fully.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>
  </subsection>
  <conclusion>
    <p>
      We have much more to talk about with integration. From here, we can move on to more systematic strategies <mdash/> ones that have some goals based on familiar things like operations that we might notice or specific variable substitutions that can be useful.
