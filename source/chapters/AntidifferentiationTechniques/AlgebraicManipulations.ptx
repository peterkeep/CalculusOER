  <title>Manipulating Integrands to Reveal Substitution</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We've looked at how to use a variable substitution to antidifferentiate composite functions. We've already seen, though, that sometimes identifying and actually using a helpful substitution can be difficult to do. In this section, we want to introduce some different strategies for noticing and setting up useful substitutions in some specific instances.

    <title>Antidifferentiating Rational Functions</title>
    <p>
      Strategies for antidifferentiating rational functions are just that: strategies. There aren't really easy ways to antidifferentiate these, but we'll find some common tactics to apply and try to build our intuition for noticing the different kinds of structure we can have in these rational functions. All of these strategies are based around cleverly re-writing our rational functions (using some algebraic manipulations) to reveal some structure. We'll try to notice the structure, so that we know what we're trying to reveal.
