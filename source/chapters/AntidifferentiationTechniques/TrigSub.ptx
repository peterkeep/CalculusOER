  <title>Trigonometric Substitution</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We're going to look at an integral that requires a variable substitution, but our goal for the substitution will be a bit different. We're going to focus on the structure of our integrand function, but we won't be focusing on composition. Instead, we're going to focus on some trigonometric identities that we've used already:
      <md>
        <mrow>\sin^2(\theta) \amp =1-\cos^2(\theta)</mrow>
        <mrow>\tan^2(\theta) \amp =\sec^2(\theta)-1</mrow>
        <mrow>\sec^2(\theta) \amp = \tan^2(\theta)+1</mrow>
      </md>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-AnotherVariableSubstitution">
    <title>Another Type of Variable Substitution</title>
    <p>
      We're going to employ another variable substitution, in the same way that we use <m>u</m>-substitution. The main difference is the goal: we're going to select our substitution not based on uncovering the composition in our function (like in <m>u</m>-substitution). Instead, we'll focus on selecting a trigonometric function in order to utilize the relevant Pythagorean identity to re-write our sum or difference of squares.

              Two rectangles, one labeled "x Context" and the other, beside it, labeled "theta Context." Inside the "x Context" rectangle is an integral of f(x) dx with an arrow pointing towards F(x)+C. Inside the "theta Context" rectangle is an integral of g(theta) d theta with an arrow pointing towards G(theta)+C. There is an arrow connecting the integral of f(x) dx in the first rectangle to the integral of g(theta) d theta labeled x=T(theta) and dx = T'(theta) d theta. Then there is an arrow connecting G(theta)+C to F(x)+C labeled x = T(theta)

      Ok, but how do we choose which trigonometric function to use in our substitution? Since we're focussing on sums or differences of squared terms, we can think of the different arrangements of terms, connect them with different Pythagorean identities, and set up some strategies for picking a trigonometric substitution.
      <md>
        <mrow> 1-x^2 \amp \longleftrightarrow  1-\sin^2(\theta) = \cos^2(\theta)</mrow>
        <mrow> x^2-1 \amp \longleftrightarrow \sec^2(\theta)-1=\tan^2(\theta)</mrow>
        <mrow> x^2+1 \amp \longleftrightarrow \tan^2(\theta)+1 = \sec^2(\theta)</mrow>
      </md>
      We can note that the sum is commutative, so we can treat <m>1+x^2</m> the same that we treat <m>x^2+1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll also notice that the constant term can differ: we can scale our Pythagorean identities by some constant easily to make sure that they match.
      <md>
        <mrow> a^2-x^2 \amp \longleftrightarrow  a^2-\left(a\sin(\theta)\right)^2 = \left(a\cos(\theta)\right)^2</mrow>
        <mrow> x^2-a^2 \amp \longleftrightarrow \left(a\sec(\theta)\right)^2-a^2=\left(a\tan(\theta)\right)^2</mrow>
        <mrow> x^2+a^2 \amp \longleftrightarrow \left(a\tan(\theta)\right)^2+a^2 = \left(a\sec(\theta)\right)^2</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be confusing, and we want to keep thinking about how we might recognize these structures to pick a substitution. Yes, we can recognize these Pythagorean identities. We can rely on the order of subtraction or noticing addition. But we can also think about this geometrically. The Pythagorean identities come from the Pythagorean Theorem, relating the squared lengths of the sides of a right triangle together. Let's visualize our substitutions geometrically.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll consider three triangles, each with side lengths of <m>x</m> and <m>a</m>. The third side length will vary between <m>\sqrt{x^2-a^2}</m>, <m>\sqrt{a^2-x^2}</m>, and <m>\sqrt{x^2+a^2}</m> (or the equivalent <m>\sqrt{a^2+x^2}</m>) based on which length is representing the hypotenuse.
    </p>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-TrigSubTriangles.ptx" />
    <p>
      This gives us a nice strategy for substitution!

      Two things to note before we move on:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            There are really 6 main trigonometric substitutions. If you go back to <xref ref="act-TrigSubTriangles"/> and place the angle <m>\theta</m> in the opposite corner of the triangle, the substitutions you build will all be using the "co-functions": cosine, cosecant, and cotangent. Each of these has a very similar structure with regard to derivatives (for the differential substitution) and Pythagorean identities. Each is equivalent to the respective sine, secant, and tangent substitutions. We often choose to use sine, secant, and tangent just due to familiarity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We can use the triangle as a kind of key for our substitution! After antidifferentiating, we have some antiderivative family written in terms of an angle <m>\theta</m>: we can use the triangle to substitution trigonometric functions of <m>\theta</m> to be written in terms of <m>x</m>. 
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          We can finish the substitution we started in <xref ref="act-DifferenceOfSquares"/>. We used the substitution <m>x=\sin(\theta)</m>, but we can now construct the relevant triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we were hoping so use a substitution to re-write the difference of squares, <m>\sqrt{1-x^2}</m>, we had the following triangle:

          We can see that <m>\sin(\theta)=\dfrac{x}{1}</m> or <m>x=\sin(\theta)</m>, which was our substitution.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we were also left with the following antiderivative:

            <mrow> \amp = \frac{\theta + \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{2}+C</mrow>
          </md>
          Now we can substitute that antiderivative! We can see from our triangle that <m>\cos(\theta)=\sqrt{1-x^2}</m>, <m>\sin(\theta)=x</m> (this was also our original substitution anyways), and we also can invert our substitution to get <m>\theta=\sin^{-1}(x)</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>\int \sqrt{1-x^2}\;dx \amp = \int \cos^2(\theta)\;d\theta</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \frac{\theta + \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)}{2}+C</mrow>
            <mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sin^{-1}(x) + x\sqrt{1-x^2}\right)+C</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <xi:include href="./activities/act-TrigSubPractice.ptx" />
    <p>
      Trigonometric substitution is pretty involved technique! Setting up the substitution is definitely not trivial. Because our substitution involves trigonometric functions, we end up with integrals of trigonometric functions that we then have to work to antidifferentiate. And substituting back to <m>x</m> relies on us having set up a robust substitution strategy from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can sometimes seem like this strategy is barely relevant: the goal of it is so focussed on the specific structure of the Pythagorean identities, and these might not feel very present.
    </p>
    <p>
      A friend of mine, though, says that once we start recognizing sums and differences of squares as being connected to Pythagoras, it's hard to <em>not</em> see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, we can go back to <xref ref="thm-GeneralizedInvTan"/> and see the sum of squares in the denominator. Instead of doing any tricky factoring to get the <m>u</m>-substitution to work, we could instead try a trigonometric substitution and get the same thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      Another friend of mine says that trigonometric substitution only exists so that we can evaluate arc length integrals (<xref ref="subsec-ArcLength" text="title"/>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever the case, this new substitution strategy should, at the very least, generalize the concept of a variable substitution in an integral to show that we can define these for a variety of purposes, all based on the kinds of structures that we're seeing in the integrand function itself.
