  <em>Instructions:</em> Consider the following integral. We'll perform integration by parts on it and explore how our selection of the parts might impact things.
</p>
<me>\int \left($f\right)$g \;dx</me>

<p>
  Select your choice for <m>u</m> (the part that you'll differentiate) and <m>dv</m> (the part that you'll antidifferentiate).
</p>
<tabular>
  <row>
    <cell>
      <choiceInput name="uChoice">
       <choice name="uf"><m>u=$f</m></choice>
        <choice name="ug"><m>u=$g</m></choice>
      </choiceInput>
    </cell>
    <cell>
      <m>\displaystyle v = $v</m>
    </cell>
  </row>
  <row>
    <cell>
      <m>\displaystyle du = $du\;dx</m>
    </cell>
    <cell>

<choiceInput name="dvChoice">
  <choice name="dvf"><m>dv = ($f)\;dx</m></choice>
  <choice name="dvg"><m>dv = $g\;dx</m></choice>
</choiceInput>
    </cell>
  </row>
</tabular>

<p>
  When we apply integration by parts, we get:
  <md>
    <mrow> \int $f $g\;dx \amp = uv-\int v\;du</mrow>
    <mrow> \amp =$uv- \int \left($vdu\right)\;dx</mrow>
  </md>
  Do you think this selection is reasonable? How would you antidifferentiate this new function in the integral part of the formula?

      <p>
        Finish making your selections for <m>u</m> and <m>dv</m>. Which of these functions would you like to differentiate, and which of these functions would you like to antidifferentiate?
      </p>
    </case>
    <case condition="($uISf and $dvISf) or ($uISg and $dvISg)">
      <p>
        Wait, did you select <m>$uChoice</m> and <m>$dvChoice</m>? Both of these are using the same function: <m>$u</m>. How can you change your choice, so that your choices include both functions?
      </p>
    </case>
    <case condition="$uISg and $dvISf">
      <p>
        Hm...this uses both functions in the formula, but the resulting integral looks worse! Antidifferentiating <m>(<derivative>$v</derivative>)</m> seemed to be a bad idea here.
      </p>
    </case>
    <case condition="$uISf and $dvISg">
      <p>
        This is great! You got to differentiate <m>$u</m> and antidifferentiate <m><derivative>$v</derivative></m>. The resulting integral is hopefully something a bit easier to approach!
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you think you could repeat another integration by parts process on the following integral?
        <me>\int $vdu \;dx</me>
        What would you select for the part you want to differentiate? What about the part you'd like to antidifferentiate?
