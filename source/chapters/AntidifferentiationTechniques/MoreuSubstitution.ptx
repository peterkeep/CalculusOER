    <title>More on <m>u</m>-Substitution</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            We're going to do some more thinking about an integration topic that we've technically already introduced in <xref ref="sec-uSubstitution"/>. We're going to do a bit more with it now, and try to build some more flexibility, so definitely review that introduction section if you'd like!
        </p>
        <p>
            Before moving on, we should work through these few examples, just to make sure we remember what we're up to.

        <title>Variable Substitution in Integrals</title>
        <p>
            In <m>u</m>-substitution, we focus a lot on one specific kind of structure: composition in our integrand function and/or some function-derivative pairing present. We do this because we're undo-ing the <xref ref="thm-ChainRule" text="title"/>. Variable substitutions can be much more general in their goal, but this is a good one to focus on because it solves a specific problem that we might run into while integrating.

        <p>
            But we can use <m>u</m>-substitution more generally as a kind of grouping mechanism.
